Written by Taylor Swift, Jack Antonoff, Zoë Kravitz, Mark Anthony Spears, Jahaan Akil Sweet &
Sam Dew

Meet me at midnight ...
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don’t ever say too much
And you don’t really read into
My melancholia
I been under scrutiny
You handle it beautifully
All this shit is new to me
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I’m damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
All they keep asking me
Is if I’m gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see
Is a one night or a wife
I find it dizzying
They’re bringing up my history
But you weren’t even listening
Chorus
That lavender haze
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
Chorus
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

►Lyrics:
Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff

Baby love, I think I’ve been a little too kind
Didn’t notice you walking all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Putting someone first only works
When you’re in their top 5
And by the way
I’m going out tonight

Best believe I’m still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, “Do you have a man?”
I could still say, “I don’t remember”
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don’t put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real
I polish up real nice
NICE!

Baby boy, I think I’ve been too good of a girl 
Too good of a girl
Did all the extra credit then got graded on a curve
I think it’s time to teach some lessons
I made you my world
Have you heard
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you
But I miss sparkling …

Chorus

Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my aura’s moonstone
Just ‘cause he was high
And we’re dancing all night
And you can try
To change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What’s a girl gonna do?
A diamond’s gotta shine

Chorus
And we’re dancing all night
And you can try
To change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What’s a girl gonna do?
What’s a girl gonna do? 
I polish up nice
Best believe I’m still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer

Written by Taylor Swift, Jack Antonoff and Lana Del Rey

One night a few moons ago I 
Saw flecks of what could’ve been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can’t stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I’m unglued - thanks to you

And it’s like snow at the beach
Weird but fuckin’ beautiful 
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight
Feels impossible
But it’s comin’ down, no sound, it’s all around
Like snow on the beach

This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen 
I searched ‘aurora borealis green’
I’ve never seen
someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it’s fine to fake it ’til you make it
Til you do
Til it’s true

Now it’s like snow at the beach
Weird but fuckin’ beautiful 
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight
Feels impossible
But it’s comin’ down, no sound, it’s all around
Like snow on the beach

I can’t speak, afraid to jinx it
I don’t even dare to wish it
But your eyes are flying saucers
From another planet
Now I’m all for you like Janet
Can this be a real thing, can it?

Are we falling like
snow at the beach
Weird but fuckin’ beautiful 
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight
Feels impossible
But it’s comin’ down, no sound, it’s all around
Like snow on the beach

Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff

Your ex-friend’s sister met someone at a club and he kissed her 
Turns out it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago, some wannabe Z-lister 
and all the outfits were terrible  
2003 unbearable  
Did you see the photos? 
No, I didn’t but thanks though 
 
I’m so in love that I might stop breathing  
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling  
No, I didn’t see the news  
Cause we were somewhere else  
Stumble down pretend alleyways 
Cheap wine make believe it’s Champagne  
I was taken by the view 
Like we were in Paris
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris
We were somewhere else
  
Privacy sign on the door  
And on my page and on the whole world  
Romance is not dead  
If you keep it just yours  
Levitate above all the messes made 
Sit quiet by my side in the shade  
And not the kind that’s thrown, I mean 
The kind under where a tree has grown  

Chorus  

I want to brainwash you into loving me forever  
I want to transport you to somewhere the culture’s clever  
Confess my truth in swooping, sloping, cursive letters  
Let the only flashing lights  
Be the tower at midnight  
In my mind  

We drew a map on your bedroom ceiling  
No, I didn’t see the news  
Cause we were somewhere else  
In an alleyway 
Drinking Champagne  
Cause we were in Paris  
Yes, we were somewhere else  
My love, we were in Paris  
Yes, we were somewhere else

Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff

It only hurts this much right now
Was what I was thinking the whole time
Breathe in, breathe through
Breathe deep, breathe out
I’ll be getting over you my whole life
You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
It can’t last

Uh oh, I’m falling in love
Oh no, I’m falling in love again
Oh, I’m falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How’d you turn it right around

It only feels this raw right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
Break up, break free, break through, break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile
You know how much I hate that everybody just expects me to 
bounce back
Just like that

Chorus x4

►Lyrics:
Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff

I remember 

Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices
We had one thing going on
I swear that it was something
Cause I don’t remember who I was before you
Painted all my nights
a color I have searched for since
But one thing after another
Fuckin’ situations, circumstances 
Miscommunications and I 
Have to say
By the way
I just may like some explanations

Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was 
making fun of you
But 15 seconds later they were clapping too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night?
Did you wish you’d put up more of a fight
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch … her?
It’s just a question

Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize out of time
She was on your mind
With some dickhead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on something
It was one drink after another
Fuckin’ politics and gender roles
And you’re not sure and I don’t know
Got swept away in the gray
I just may like to have a conversation

Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was 
making fun of you
But 15 seconds later they were clapping too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night?
Did you wish you’d put up more of a fight
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch … her?
It’s just a question

Does it feel like everything’s just like second best after that 
meteor strike?
And what’s that that I heard, that you’re still with her
that’s nice, I’m sure that’s what’s suitable
And right
But tonight …

Can I ask you a question? 
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was 
making fun of you
But 15 seconds later they were clapping too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night?
Did you wish you’d put up more of a fight
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch … her?
It’s just a question

►Lyrics:
Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff

When the morning came we
Were cleaning incense off your
vinyl shelf ‘cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
“How’d we end up on the floor anyway?”
You say
“Your roommate’s cheap-ass screw top rosé, 
That’s how.”
I see you every day now

And I chose you
The one I was dancing with in New York
No shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into 
me and how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet it 
was
The mark they saw on my collarbone the rust that grew
between telephones the lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

When the silence came we
Were shaking blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain’t that the way shit always ends 
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses
That’s us
I feel you no matter what
The rubies that I gave up

And I lost you
The one I was dancing with in New York
No shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was (maroon)
The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into 
me and how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet it 
was (maroon)
The mark they saw on my collarbone the rust that grew 
between telephones the lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

And I wake with your memory over me
That’s a real fuckin’ legacy, legacy 
And I wake with your memory over me
That’s a real fuckin’ legacy … to leave 

The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into 
me and how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet it 
was (maroon)
The mark they saw on my collarbone the rust that grew 
between telephones the lips I used to call home
So scarlet it was maroon

It was maroon (x2)

Meet me at midnight …

Staring at the ceiling with you 
Oh, you don’t ever say too much 
And you don’t really read into
My melancholia 
I been under scrutiny 
You handle it beautifully 
All this shit is new to me 

I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me 
Surreal 
I’m damned if I do give a damn what people say 
No deal 
The 1950s shit they want from me 
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze 

All they keep asking me
Is if I’m gonna be your bride 
The only kinda girl they see 
Is a one night or a wife 
I find it dizzying 
They’re bringing up my history 
But you weren’t even listening 

Chorus
That lavender haze 

Talk your talk and go viral 
I just need this love spiral 
Get it off your chest 
Get it off my desk 
Talk your talk and go viral 
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest 
Get it off my desk 

Chorus 

Get it off your chest 
Get it off my desk
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

Written by Taylor Swift and William Bowery

I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh …

They said the end is coming
Everyone’s up to something
I find myself running home to your 
Sweet nothings
Outside they’re push and shoving
You’re in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
Sweet nothing

On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, “what a mind”
This happens all the time
Ooh …

Cause they said the end is coming
Everyone’s up to something
I find myself running home to your 
Sweet nothings
Outside they’re push and shoving
You’re in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
… nothing

Industry disrupters and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters
Out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore
“You should be doing more”
To you I can admit
That I’m just too soft for all of it
Ooh …

Chorus x2

►Lyrics:
 Written by Taylor Swift and Aaron Dessner

My knuckles were bruised like violets 
Sucker punching walls 
Cursed you as I sleep talked 
Spineless in my tomb of silence 
Tore your banners down 
Took the battle underground 
And maybe it was egos swinging 
Maybe it was her 
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur 

All that bloodshed 
Crimson clover 
Uh huh, sweet dream was over 
My hand was the one you reached for 
All throughout the Great War
Always remember, uh huh 
Tears on the letter 
I vowed not to cry anymore 
If we survived the Great War 

You drew up some good faith treaties 
I drew curtains closed 
Drank my poison all alone 
You said I have to trust more freely 
But diesel is desire
You were playing with fire
And maybe it’s the past that’s talking 
Screaming from the crypt 
Telling me to punish you for things you never did 
So I justified it

All that bloodshed, crimson clover 
Uh huh, the bombs were closer 
My hand was the one you reached for 
All throughout the Great War 
Always remember, uh huh 
The burning embers 
I vowed not to fight anymore 
If we survived the Great War 
Uh huh, uh huh

It turned into something bigger 
Somewhere in the haze 
Got a sense I’d been betrayed 
Your finger on my hairpin triggers 
Soldier down 
On that icy ground 
Looked up at me with honor and truth 
Broken and blue 
So I called off the troops 
That was the night I nearly lost you 
I really thought I’d lost you 

We can plant a memory garden 
Say a solemn prayer
Place a poppy in my hair 
There’s no morning glory 
It was war it wasn’t fair 
And we will never go back to that 

Bloodshed, crimson clover 
Uh huh, the worst was over
My hand was the one you reached for 
All throughout the Great War 
Always remember, uh huh 
We’re burned for better 
I vowed I would always be yours
Cause we survived the Great War
Uh huh, uh huh
I will always be yours
Cause we survived the Great War
Uh huh 
I vowed I will always be yours

You’re talking shit 
For the hell of it 
Addicted to betrayal 
But you’re relevant 
You’re terrified to look down
Cause if you dare 
You’ll see the glare 
Of everyone you burned just to get there 
It’s coming back around 
And I keep my side of the street clean 
You wouldn’t know what I mean 

Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god 
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend 
Karma’s a relaxing thought 
Aren’t you envious that for you it’s not?
Sweet like honey
Karma is a cat 
Purring in my lap ‘cause it loves me 
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat 
Me and karma vibe like that 

Spiderboy, king of thieves 
Weave your little webs of opacity 
My pennies made your crown 
Trick me once 
Trick me twice 
Don’t you know that cash ain’t the only price 
It’s coming back around 
And I keep my side of the street clean 
You wouldn’t know what I mean

Chorus 

Ask me what I learned from all those years 
Ask me what I earned from all those tears 
Ask me why so many fade but I’m still here

Cause karma is the thunder 
Rattling your ground 
Karma’s on your scent like a bounty hunter 
Karma’s gonna track you down
Step by step from town to town 
Sweet like justice 
Karma is a queen 
Karma takes all my friends to the summit 
Karma is the guy on the screen coming straight home to me 

Chorus 

Karma is my boyfriend 
Karma is a god

►Lyrics:
Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff

No words appear before me in the aftermath 
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears 
Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness 
Cause it’s all over now 
All out to sea 

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky 
You were more than just a short time 
And I’ve got a lot to pine about 
I’ve got a lot to live without 
I’m never gonna meet 
What could’ve been, would’ve been 
What should’ve been you 
What could’ve been, would’ve been you

Did some bird flap its wings over in Asia 
Did some force take you because I didn’t pray  
Every single thing to come has turned into ashes
Cause it’s all over 
It’s not meant to be 
So I’ll say words I don’t believe 

Chorus x2

Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff 

Dear reader,
If it feels like a trap 
You’re already in one 
Dear reader, 
Get out your map
Pick somewhere and just run 
Dear reader, 
Burn all the files, desert all your past lives 
And if you don’t recognize yourself 
That means you did it right 

Never take advice from someone who’s falling apart 
Never take advice from someone who’s falling apart 

Dear reader,
Bend when you can
Snap when you have to 
Dear reader,
You don’t have to answer
Just ‘cause they asked you 
Dear reader, 
The greatest of luxuries is your secrets
Dear reader, 
When you aim at the devil 
Make sure you don’t miss 

Never take advice from someone who’s falling apart 
Never take advice from someone who’s falling apart 

So I wander through these nights 
I prefer hiding in plain sight 
My fourth drink in my hand 
These desperate prayers of a cursed man

Spilling out to you for free 
But darling, darling, please 
You wouldn’t take my word for it 
If you knew who was talking 
If you knew where I was walking 
To a house, not a home, all alone 
Cause nobody’s there 
Where I pace in my pen and 
my friends found friends who care 
No one sees when you lose 
when you’re playing solitaire 

You should find another guiding light 
Guiding light 
But I shine so bright 
You should find another guiding light 
Guiding light 
But I shine so bright …

Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff

Baby love, I think I’ve been a little too kind
Didn’t notice you walking all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Putting someone first only works
When you’re in their top 5
And by the way
I’m going out tonight

Best believe I’m still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, “Do you have a man?”
I could still say, “I don’t remember”
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don’t put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real
I polish up real nice
NICE!

Baby boy, I think I’ve been too good of a girl 
Too good of a girl
Did all the extra credit then got graded on a curve
I think it’s time to teach some lessons
I made you my world
Have you heard
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you
But I miss sparkling …

Chorus

Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my aura’s moonstone
Just ‘cause he was high
And we’re dancing all night
And you can try
To change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What’s a girl gonna do?
A diamond’s gotta shine

Chorus
And we’re dancing all night
And you can try
To change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What’s a girl gonna do?
What’s a girl gonna do? 
I polish up nice
Best believe I’m still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer

Written by Taylor Swift, Jack Antonoff, Sam Dew, Anthony Spears

We were supposed to be just friends
You don’t live in my part of town but maybe I’ll see you out some weekend 
Depending on what kind of mood and situation-ship I’m in
And what’s in my system

I think there’s been a glitch
Five seconds later I’m fastening myself to you with a stitch 
And I’m not even sorry
Nights are so starry 
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there’s been a glitch

I was supposed to sweat you out
In search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone else’s playground 
But it’s been 2,190 days of our love blackout
The system’s breaking down 

Chorus

A brief interruption 
A slight malfunction
I’d go back to wanting 
Dudes who give nothing
I thought we had no chance … 
And that’s romance
Let’s dance 

Glitch
Five seconds later I’m fastening myself to you with a stitch 
And I’m not even sorry
Nights are so starry 
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there’s been a glitch

Written by Taylor Swift

Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things but I’m the worst of them
Sometimes I wonder which one will be your last lie
They say looks can kill and I might try
I don’t dress for women
I don’t dress for men

Lately I’ve been dressing for revenge
I don’t start shit but I can tell you how it ends 
Don’t get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don’t dress for friends
Lately I’ve been dressing for revenge

She needed cold hard proof so I gave her some
She had the envelope, where you think she got it from? 
Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife
And she looks so pretty
Driving in your Benz
Lately she’s been dressing for revenge

She don’t start shit but she can tell you how it ends 
Don’t get sad, get even
So on the weekends
She don’t dress for friends
Lately she’s been dressing for revenge

Ladies always rise above
Ladies know what people want
Someone sweet and kind and fun
The lady simply had enough …
While he was doing lines
And crossing all of mine
Someone told his white collar crimes to the FBI
And I don’t dress for villains 
Or for innocents
I’m on my vigilante shit again

I don’t start shit but I can tell you how it ends 
Don’t get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don’t dress for friends
Lately I’ve been dressing for revenge

Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff

Once upon a time
The planets and the fates and all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room at the same time
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn’t lose

What if I told you
None of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork
And then just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I’m a mastermind
And now you’re mine
It was all by design
Cause I’m a mastermind

You see all the wisest women had to do it this way
Cause we were born to be the pawn in every lover’s game
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
I’m the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails

What if I told you
None of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me
I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork
And then just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I’m a mastermind
And now you’re mine
It was all my design
Cause I’m a mastermind

No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So I’ve been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless
This is the first time I’ve felt the need to confess
And I swear
I’m only cryptic and Machiavellian ‘cause I care

So I told you
None of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork
And then saw a wide smirk
On your face, you knew the entire time
You knew that I’m a mastermind
And now you’re mine
Yeah, all you did was smile
Cause I’m a mastermind

Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I’ve ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices, they come with prices and vices, I end up in crisis
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming one day I’ll watch as you’re leaving ‘cause you got tired of my scheming - for the last time

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I’m a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out
Slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism like some kind of congressman 
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming 
one day I’ll watch as you’re leaving and life will lose all its meaning - for the last time 

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers ‘round and reads it
And then someone screams out
“She’s laughing up at us from hell!”

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me

It’s me
Hi

Everybody agrees
Everybody agrees

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Written by Taylor Swift and Aaron Dessner

If you would’ve blinked then I would’ve 
Looked away at the first glance 
If you tasted poison you could’ve 
Spit me out at the first chance 
If I was some paint did it splatter 
On a promising grown man 
And if I was a child, did it matter 
If you got to wash your hands 
Oh, all I used to do was pray 
Would’ve, could’ve, should’ve  
If you’d never looked my way 

I would’ve stayed 
On my knees
And I damn sure never would’ve danced with the devil 
At nineteen, and the god’s honest truth is that the pain was heaven 
And now that I’m grown 
I’m scared of ghosts 
Memories feel like weapons 
And now that I know 
I wish you’d left me wondering 

If you never touched me I would’ve 
Gone along with the righteous 
If I never blushed then they could’ve
Never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom 
I could’ve gone on as I was 
But lord, you made me feel important 
And then you tried to erase us 
Oh, you’re a crisis of my faith 
Would’ve, could’ve, should’ve  
If I’d only played it safe 

I would’ve stayed 
On my knees
And I damn sure never would’ve danced with the devil 
At nineteen, and the god’s honest truth is that the pain was heaven 
And now that I’m grown 
I’m scared of ghosts 
Memories feel like weapons 
And now that I know 
I wish you’d left me wondering 
God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be 
The tomb won’t close 
Stained glass windows in my mind 
I regret you all the time 
Can’t let this go 
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won’t close
I keep on waiting for a sign 
I regret you all the time
 
If clarity’s in death then why won’t this die?
Years of tearing down our banners 
You and I 
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts 
Give me back my girlhood 
It was mine first 

And I damn sure never would’ve danced with the devil 
At nineteen, and the god’s honest truth is that the pain was heaven 
And now that I’m grown 
I’m scared of ghosts 
Memories feel like weapons 
And now that I know 
I wish you’d left me wondering 

God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be 
The tomb won’t close 
Stained glass windows in my mind 
I regret you all the time 
I can’t let this go 
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won’t close
I keep on waiting for a sign 
I regret you all the time 

Oh, god rest my soul
I miss who I used to be 
The tomb won’t close 
Stained glass windows in my mind 
I regret you all the time 
I can’t let this go 
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won’t close
I keep on waiting for a sign 
I regret you all the time

Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff

He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight …

My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart ‘cause he was nice

He was sunshine
I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight …

It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him it’s every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away

Cause he was sunshine 
I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight


He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

I guess sometimes we all get
just what we wanted, just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except when I’m on TV
I guess sometimes we all get 
some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this …

►Lyrics:
Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff

Summer went away
Still the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently
He’s gonna notice me
It’s ok, we’re the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice
You’re smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it’s your face
I didn’t choose this town
I dream of getting out
There’s just one who could make me stay
All my days

From sprinkler splashes
To fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party
Of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared
You’re on your own, kid
You always have been

I see the great escape
So long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed
Writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I’ll run away

From sprinkler splashes 
To fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party
Of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren’t rare
You’re on your own, kid
You always have been

From sprinkler splashes 
To fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I’d be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren’t funny
I took the money
My friends from home don’t know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can’t take away
Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So make the friendship bracelets
Take the moment and taste it
You’ve got no reason to be afraid
You’re on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You’re on your own, kid
You always have been

Written by Taylor Swift and Aaron Dessner

Lock broken
Slur spoken 
Wound open 
Game token 
I didn’t know you were keeping count 
Rain soaking 
Blind hoping 
You said I was 
Freeloading 
I didn’t know you were keeping count 

High infidelity 
Put on your records 
And regret me 
I bent the truth too far tonight 
I was dancing around 
Dancing around it 
High infidelity 
Put on your headphones 
And burn my city 
Your picket fence is sharp as knives 
I was dancing around 
Dancing around it 

Do you really want to know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes? 

Storm coming 
Good husband 
Bad omen 
Dragged my feet right down the aisle 
At the house lonely 
Good money 
I’d pay if you’d just know me 
Seemed like the right thing at the time 
You know there’s many different ways that you can kill the one you love 
The slowest way is never loving them enough 
Do you really want to know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to tell you how he brought me back to life?

High infidelity 
Put on your records and regret me 
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around 
Dancing around it

High infidelity 
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it

Do you really want to know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?
You know there’s many different ways that you can kill the one you love 
The slowest way is never loving them enough

High infidelity 
Put on your records and regret meeting me 
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around 
Dancing around it

High infidelity 
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around
Dancing around it

Oh, there’s many different ways that you can kill the one you love 
And it’s never enough, it’s never enough

Lock broken
Slur spoken 
Wound open 
Game token 
I didn’t know you were keeping count 
Rain soaking 
Blind hoping 
You said I was 
Freeloading 
I didn’t know you were keeping count 
But oh, you were keeping count

►Lyrics:
Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I’ve ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices, they come with prices and vices, I end up in crisis
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming one day I’ll watch as you’re leaving ‘cause you got tired of my scheming - for the last time

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I’m a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out
Slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism like some kind of congressman 
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming 
one day I’ll watch as you’re leaving and life will lose all its meaning - for the last time 

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers ‘round and reads it
And then someone screams out
“She’s laughing up at us from hell!”

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me

It’s me
Hi

Everybody agrees
Everybody agrees

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Official Lyrics:
 
Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
 
In silent screams
In wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this
 
This love is good
This love is bad
This love is alive
Back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me
 
Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in the night for only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone
In losing grip
On sinking ships
You showed up just in time
 
This love is good
This love is bad
This love is alive
Back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me
 
Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you’re young, you just run
But you come back to what you need
 
This love is good
This love is bad
This love is alive
Back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me
 
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me
 
This love came back to me

Lyrics:

I walked through the door with you 
The air was cold 
But somethin bout it felt like home somehow 
And I left my scarf there at your sister’s house 
And you’ve still got it in your drawer even now 
Oh your sweet disposition, and my wide eyed gaze 
We’re singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place 
And I can picture it after all these days 
And I know it’s long gone and that magic’s not here no more 
And I might be ok but I’m not fine at all…

Cause there we are again on that 
Little town street 
You almost ran the red 
Cause you were looking over at me 
Wind in my hair, I was there 
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter 
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses
in a twin-sized bed 
And your mother’s telling stories bout you on 
the tee ball team 
You taught me bout your past 
Thinkin your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys 
‘F*** the patriarchy’ keychain on the ground
We were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down
Any time now, he’s gonna say it’s love
You never called it what it was
til we were dead and gone and buried 
Check the pulse and come back 
Swearing it’s the same, after 3 months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to
As I reached for you but
All I felt was shame
And you held my lifeless frame 
And I know it’s long gone and 
There was nothing else I could do 
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to… 

Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We’re dancin round the kitchen in the 
refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well…
And there we are again 
When nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret
But I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we’d swear 
to remember it all too well 

Well maybe we got lost in translation 
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again 
Just to break me like a promise 
So casually cruel in the name of being honest 
I’m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all, all, all 
They say all’s well that ends well
But I’m in a new hell every time
You double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age
Maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die.

The idea you had of me
Who was she?
A never-needy, ever lovely jewel
Whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened
You.
That’s what happened: You.
You, who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you were on a late night show
But then he watched me watch the front door 
all night, willing you to come
And he said, “it’s supposed to be fun… 
Turning 21” 

Time won’t fly
It’s like I’m paralyzed by it 
I’d like to be my old self again
But I’m still trying to find it 
After plaid shirt days 
And nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things 
And I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence, and it smells like me 
You can’t get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well

Cause there we are again when
I loved you so 
Back before you lost the one real thing
You’ve ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there 
You remember it all 
Down the stairs, you were there 
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at telling jokes 
But the punchline goes:
“I’ll get older, but your lovers stay my age”
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I’m a soldier who’s returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
Cause in this city’s barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us did the love affair maim you 
All too well
Just between us, do you remember it 
All too well
Just between us, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair 
I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there
I was there
Sacred prayer
I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
All too well

Lyrics:

I walked through the door with you 
The air was cold 
But somethin bout it felt like home somehow 
And I left my scarf there at your sister’s house 
And you’ve still got it in your drawer even now 
Oh your sweet disposition, and my wide eyed gaze 
We’re singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place 
And I can picture it after all these days 
And I know it’s long gone and that magic’s not here no more 
And I might be ok but I’m not fine at all…

Cause there we are again on that 
Little town street 
You almost ran the red 
Cause you were looking over at me 
Wind in my hair, I was there 
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter 
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses
in a twin-sized bed 
And your mother’s telling stories bout you on 
the tee ball team 
You taught me bout your past 
Thinkin your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys 
‘F*** the patriarchy’ keychain on the ground
We were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down
Any time now, he’s gonna say it’s love
You never called it what it was
til we were dead and gone and buried 
Check the pulse and come back 
Swearing it’s the same, after 3 months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to
As I reached for you but
All I felt was shame
And you held my lifeless frame 
And I know it’s long gone and 
There was nothing else I could do 
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to… 

Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We’re dancin round the kitchen in the 
refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well…
And there we are again 
When nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret
But I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we’d swear 
to remember it all too well 

Well maybe we got lost in translation 
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again 
Just to break me like a promise 
So casually cruel in the name of being honest 
I’m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all, all, all 
They say all’s well that ends well
But I’m in a new hell every time
You double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age
Maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die.

The idea you had of me
Who was she?
A never-needy, ever lovely jewel
Whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened
You.
That’s what happened: You.
You, who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you were on a late night show
But then he watched me watch the front door 
all night, willing you to come
And he said, “it’s supposed to be fun… 
Turning 21” 

Time won’t fly
It’s like I’m paralyzed by it 
I’d like to be my old self again
But I’m still trying to find it 
After plaid shirt days 
And nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things 
And I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence, and it smells like me 
You can’t get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well

Cause there we are again when
I loved you so 
Back before you lost the one real thing
You’ve ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there 
You remember it all 
Down the stairs, you were there 
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at telling jokes

All too well

I was there
Sacred prayer
I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
All too well

Lyrics:

I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But somethin bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now
Oh your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay but I’m not fine at all...

Cause there we are again on that
Little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were
Looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses
In a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 
About you on the tee ball team
You taught me about your past
Thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to...

Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing ‘round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Till you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I’m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all, all, all...too well

Time won't fly, it's like I’m paralyzed by it

Made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I 
Walk home alone

You can't get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

Lyrics:

3am and I’m still awake
I bet you’re just fine, fast asleep in your city 
That’s better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I’ll bet your friends tell you she’s better than me
Huh

Well I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh they sit around talking ‘bout the meaning of life
And the book that just saved ‘em that I hadn’t heard of

But now that we’re done and it’s over
I bet you couldn’t believe 
When you realized I’m harder to forget
Than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

You grew up in a silver spoon gated community
Glamorous shiny bright Beverly Hills 
I was raised on a farm, no it wasn’t a mansion
Just living room dancing and kitchen table bills
But you know what they say
You can’t help who you fall for 
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we’re too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

Mr. Superior Thinking
Do you have all the space that you need?
I don’t have to be your shrink to know that
You’ll never be happy
And I bet you think about me 

I bet you think about me, yes, I bet
You think about me

Oh, block it all out
The voices so loud saying 
Why did you let her go
Does it make you feel sad 
That the love that you’re looking for
Is the love that you had

Now you’re out in the world, searching for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status 
Last time you felt free was when none of that shit mattered
Cause you were with me

But now that we’re done and it’s over
I bet it’s hard to believe
But it turned out I’m harder to forget 
Than I was to leave 
And, yeah, I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me  
I bet you think about me when you’re out 
At your cool indie music concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your million dollar couch
I bet you think about me when you say “oh my god
She’s insane, she wrote a song about me”
I bet you think about me

Lyrics:

I walked through the door with you 
The air was cold 
But somethin bout it felt like home somehow 
And I left my scarf there at your sister’s house 
And you’ve still got it in your drawer even now 
Oh your sweet disposition, and my wide eyed gaze 
We’re singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place 
And I can picture it after all these days 
And I know it’s long gone and that magic’s not here no more 
And I might be ok but I’m not fine at all…

Cause there we are again on that 
Little town street 
You almost ran the red 
Cause you were looking over at me 
Wind in my hair, I was there 
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter 
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses
in a twin-sized bed 
And your mother’s telling stories bout you on 
the tee ball team 
You taught me bout your past 
Thinkin your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys 
‘F*** the patriarchy’ keychain on the ground
We were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down
Any time now, he’s gonna say it’s love
You never called it what it was
til we were dead and gone and buried 
Check the pulse and come back 
Swearing it’s the same, after 3 months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to
As I reached for you but
All I felt was shame
And you held my lifeless frame 
And I know it’s long gone and 
There was nothing else I could do 
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to… 

Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We’re dancin round the kitchen in the 
refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well…
And there we are again 
When nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret
But I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we’d swear 
to remember it all too well 

Well maybe we got lost in translation 
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again 
Just to break me like a promise 
So casually cruel in the name of being honest 
I’m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all, all, all 
They say all’s well that ends well
But I’m in a new hell every time
You double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age
Maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die.

The idea you had of me
Who was she?
A never-needy, ever lovely jewel
Whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened
You.
That’s what happened: You.
You, who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you were on a late night show
But then he watched me watch the front door 
all night, willing you to come
And he said, “it’s supposed to be fun… 
Turning 21” 

Time won’t fly
It’s like I’m paralyzed by it 
I’d like to be my old self again
But I’m still trying to find it 
After plaid shirt days 
And nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things 
And I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence, and it smells like me 
You can’t get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well

Cause there we are again when
I loved you so 
Back before you lost the one real thing
You’ve ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there 
You remember it all 
Down the stairs, you were there 
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at telling jokes 
But the punchline goes:
“I’ll get older, but your lovers stay my age”
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I’m a soldier who’s returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
Cause in this city’s barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us did the love affair maim you 
All too well
Just between us, do you remember it 
All too well
Just between us, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair 
I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there
I was there
Sacred prayer
I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
All too well

Lyrics:

I said, “oh my, what a marvelous tune”
It was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk
Summer of '45
Picked me up late one night 
Out the window we were seventeen
And crazy, running wild wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a 
Yacht club party, pretending to 
Be a duchess and a prince 

And I said oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, “look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change.
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way.”
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
“Don't you see the starlight, starlight? Don't you dream impossible things?”

Like oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh ooh, dancing with me
Ooh ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don’t you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?

Lyrics:
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn so bright just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue, like I’d never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met 
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue, like I’d never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red, oh red, burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head…in burning red
Burning it was red

Oh, losing him was blue, like I’d never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
Cause loving him was red, yeah, yeah, red, oh burning red

And that’s why he’s spinning around in my head
Comes back to me, burning red, yeah, yeah
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street

Lyrics:

Give me the keys, I’ll bring the car back around
We shouldn’t be in this town
And my so-called friends, they don’t know
I’d drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and don’t say no, no

There’s a chain ‘round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote
“I’ll wait for you”
There’s a key on the chain, there’s a picture in a frame
Take it with you

And run, like you’d run from the law
Darling, let’s run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we’ll run
Ooh, we’ll run
Ooh, we’ll run

So you laugh like a child
And I’ll sing like no one cares
No one to be, no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and don’t say no, no 
And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
There’s a heart on your sleeve
I’ll take it when I leave
And hold it for you

And run, like you’d run from the law
Darling, let’s run
Run from it all
We can go like they’re trying to chase us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we’ll run
Ooh, we’ll run
Ooh, we’ll run

There’s been this hole in my heart
This thing was a shot in the dark
Say you’ll never let ‘em tear us apart
And I’ll hold onto you while we run

Like you’d run from the law
Darling, let’s run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we’ll run
Ooh, we’ll run
Ooh, we’ll run
Ooh, and we’ll run

Lyrics:
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity's too much
And I’ll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I’d be smart to walk away
but you're quicksand

CHORUS
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
All we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction

REPEAT CHORUS

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will…
Get you a, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind and I just…
Think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would...
Follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I...I, I, I…I, I, I…

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will...
Get you a, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind and I just...
Think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will...
Follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home

This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

Lyrics:

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""this is it, I've had enough""
Cause like
We hadn’t seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space...what?
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I’m gonna change. Trust me.""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me...
I love you
Ooh, we called it off again last night but
Ooh, this time I’m telling you, I’m telling you...

CHORUS
We are never ever ever...getting back together
We are never ever ever...getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever...getting back together

Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I’m right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
Ooh, you called me up again tonight but
Ooh, this time, I’m telling you, I’m telling you

REPEAT CHORUS

I used to think that we were forever, ever and I used to say, “never say never...”

Spoken: (sigh)...So he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you,"" and I’m like, I’m just, I mean this is exhausting you know, like we are never getting back together. Like, ever.

No
REPEAT CHORUS (x2)

Lyrics:

I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you’re sittin’ in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city and I bet
Sometimes you wonder about me

CHORUS
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't, I almost do
I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye

REPEAT CHORUS

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It's probably better off this way
And I confess, baby
In my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I’d want to try again with you
And I almost do

REPEAT CHORUS

I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sittin’ in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city and I hope
Sometimes you wonder about me

Lyrics:

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me…
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me…
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me, cause

CHORUS
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I’d never been till you put me down
Oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I’d never been
Now I’m lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you’re drowning, you’re drowning…
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I’ll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see…
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me
Hey!

REPEAT CHORUS

And the saddest fear 
Comes creeping in 
That you never loved me 
Or her...or anyone...or anything
Yeah

REPEAT CHORUS 

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

Lyrics:

I’m pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away but you…stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said , ""ok, let's talk"" and I said

CHORUS
Stay stay stay
I’ve been loving you for quite some
Time time time
You think that it's funny when I’m
Mad mad mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

Before you I’d only dated self-indulgent takers 
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I’m always laughing
And I love you because you have given me…no choice but to

REPEAT CHORUS
Stay stay stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you
All the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you
For my whole life

Stay...and I’ll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad mad mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

REPEAT CHORUS
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

REPEAT CHORUS

Spoken: (laughs) That’s so fun

Lyrics:

I wish I could fly
I’d pick you up and we’d go back in time
I’d write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

And so it goes
Every weekend, this same party
I never go alone and I don’t seem brokenhearted
My friends all say they know everything I’m going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you
Cause they don’t know about the night in the hotel
They weren’t riding in the car when we both fell
Didn’t read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don’t know how much I miss you

CHORUS
I wish I could fly
I’d pick you up and we’d go back in time
I’d write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you 
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you 

And so it was
We never saw it coming
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back then we didn’t know we were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo, then we broke each other’s hearts
But don’t forget about the night out in LA
Danced in the kitchen, chased me down through the hallway
No one knows about the words that we whispered
No one knows how much I miss you

REPEAT CHORUS

I remember the night at the hotel
I was riding in the car when we both fell
I’m the one on the phone as you whisper
“Do you know how much I miss you?”
I wish that we could go back in time
And I’d say to you
“I miss you like it was the very first night”

REPEAT CHORUS

Lyrics:

They tell you while you’re young
Girls, go out and have your fun
Then they hunt and slay the ones 
Who actually do it 
Criticize the way you fly
When you’re soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh 
And say, “She looks like she’s been through it” 
Lord what will become of me
Once I’ve lost my novelty 

I’ve had too much to drink tonight
And I know it’s sad but this is what I think about 
And I wake up in the middle of the night 
It’s like I can feel time moving 
How can a person know everything at 18
But nothing at 22? 
And will you still want me 
When I’m nothing new? 

How long will it be cute
All this crying in my room
When you can’t blame it on my youth 
And roll your eyes with affection 
And my cheeks are growing tired 
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time till I lose your attention?
And someone else lights up the room 
People love an ingénue 

I’ve had too much to drink tonight
How did I go from growing up to breaking down? 
And I wake up in the middle of the night 
It’s like I can feel time moving 
How can a person know everything at 18
But nothing at 22? 
And will you still want me 
When I’m nothing new? 

I know someday I’m gonna meet her 
It’s a fever dream
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen 
She’ll know the way and then she’ll say she got the map from me 
I’ll say I’m happy for her then I’ll cry myself to sleep
 
I’ve had too much to drink tonight 
But I wonder if they’ll miss me once they drive me out 
I wake up in the middle of the night 
And I can feel time moving 
How can a person know everything at 18 
But nothing at 22? 
And will you still want me
Will you still want me
Will you still want me
When I’m nothing new?

Lyrics:

I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back

I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up

I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming “Why?”
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray, we'll just disappear
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here

Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back

Lyrics:

I find myself at your door
Just like all those times before 
I'm not sure how I got there
All roads, they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better
And right before your eyes
I'm breaking
No past, no reasons why
Just you and me…

CHORUS
This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

You find yourself at my door
And just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better
And right before your eyes, I’m aching
No past, nowhere to hide
Just you and me...

REPEAT CHORUS

This is the last time you tell me I’ve got it wrong
This is the last time I say, “it’s been you all along”
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time I won't hurt you anymore

Oh
REPEAT CHORUS (x2)
This is the last time I’m asking you, last time I’m asking you, last time I’m asking you this
This is the last time I’m asking you, last time I’m asking you, last time I’m asking you this
This is the last time I’m asking you, last time I’m asking you, last time I’m asking you this
This is the last time I’m asking you, last time I’m asking you, last time I’m asking you this

Lyrics:

I know that you like me
And it’s kinda frightening
Standing here waiting, waiting
And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes
Tongue tied
But now you’re so far away
And I’m down  
Feeling like a face in the crowd
I’m reaching for you 
Terrified

CHORUS
Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep and
I could be the reason you can’t sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you

These days I’m restless
Workdays are endless 
Look how you made me, made me
But time moves faster
Replaying your laughter
Disaster

Cause now you’re so far away
And I’m down
Feeling like a face in the crowd
I’m reaching for you terrified

REPEAT CHORUS

How is it in London?
Where were you while I’m wonderin’
If I’ll ever see you again?

You could be the one that I love
And now I’m standing here hoping it gets to you

REPEAT CHORUS

Lyrics:

You said it in a simple way
4am, the second day
How strange that I don't 
Know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back… be here 
Come back… be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back… be here 
Come back… be here

The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back… be here 
Come back… be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back… be here 
Come back… be here
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh

This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York… be here
But you're in… London, and I break down
Cause it's not fair that you're not around

This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back… be here 
Come back… be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back… be here 
Come back… be here

Oh oh, oh oh
I don't wanna miss you like this
Oh oh, oh oh
Come back… be here 
Come back… be here

Lyrics:

Long handwritten notes, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they’ll be and long they will wait

CHORUS
We had...
A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad...
Beautiful, tragic love affair

In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
And we both wake in lonely beds and different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons and darling
They all look like me, cause

REPEAT CHORUS

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it
Could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up and for the life of us
We can't get back...

A beautiful magic love there
What a sad...
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful...

REPEAT CHORUS 

REPEAT CHORUS

Lyrics:

Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do

I walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

CHORUS
And you throw your head back laughing
Like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I’m funny cause
He never did
I've been spending the last 8 months
Thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

REPEAT CHORUS 

And we walked down the block, to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that
And for the first time
What's past is past

REPEAT CHORUS 

On a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again

Lyrics:

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now I didn’t before
And all I’ve seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles
And your smile in the back of my mind making me feel like
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you, know you, know you...

CHORUS
Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I’ll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
But I'll take ‘em down, take ‘em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies, the beautiful kind
Makin’ up for lost time, takin’ flight making me feel like
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you, know you, know you...

REPEAT CHORUS

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I’ve missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you, know you, know you...

REPEAT CHORUS

All I know is we said hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a newfound grace
All my days I’ll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Lyrics:

He says he doesn’t believe anything much he hears these days
He says, “Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?”
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be 
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity
I call just checking up on him
He’s up, 3am pacing
He says, “It’s not just a phase I’m in”
My voice comes out begging

CHORUS
All this time I didn’t know 
You were breaking down
I’d fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren’t around
Too young to know it gets better
I’ll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go…

He seems fine most of the time
Forcing smiles and never minds 
His laugh is symphony
When the lights go out it’s hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death he’ll decide to leave instead
I call just checking up on him
He’s up, 5am wasted
Long gone, not even listening
My voice comes out screaming

REPEAT CHORUS

If I was standing there in your apartment
I’d take that bomb in your head and disarm it 
I’d say I love you even at your darkest and 
Please don’t go

I didn’t know 
You were breaking down
I’d fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren’t around
Too young to know it gets better
I’ll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go…

I’ll be your summer sun forever
At 3am pacing
All this time I didn’t know
At 5am wasted
I’d be in pieces on the floor

Forever winter if you go...

He says he doesn’t believe anything much he hears these days
I say, “Believe in one thing, I won’t go away”

Lyrics:

Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that

I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility to do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This, I have previously learned

CHORUS
So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
“Don't look at me, you got a girl at home”
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

I just want to make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up, you chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her

REPEAT CHORUS
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Call a cab, lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab, lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned

Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her you’re coming home
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn't once been just like her

Lyrics:

3am and I’m still awake
I bet you’re just fine, fast asleep in your city 
That’s better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I’ll bet your friends tell you she’s better than me
Huh

Well I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh they sit around talking ‘bout the meaning of life
And the book that just saved ‘em that I hadn’t heard of

But now that we’re done and it’s over
I bet you couldn’t believe 
When you realized I’m harder to forget
Than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

You grew up in a silver spoon gated community
Glamorous shiny bright Beverly Hills 
I was raised on a farm, no it wasn’t a mansion
Just living room dancing and kitchen table bills
But you know what they say
You can’t help who you fall for 
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we’re too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

Mr. Superior Thinking
Do you have all the space that you need?
I don’t have to be your shrink to know that
You’ll never be happy
And I bet you think about me 

I bet you think about me, yes, I bet
You think about me

Oh, block it all out
The voices so loud saying 
Why did you let her go
Does it make you feel sad 
That the love that you’re looking for
Is the love that you had

Now you’re out in the world, searching for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status 
Last time you felt free was when none of that mattered
Cause you were with me

But now that we’re done and it’s over
I bet it’s hard to believe
But it turned out I’m harder to forget 
Than I was to leave 
And, yeah, I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me  
I bet you think about me when you’re out 
At your cool indie music concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your million dollar couch
I bet you think about me when you say “oh my god
She’s insane, she wrote a song about me”
I bet you think about me

Lyrics:

I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone
And lord it took me away
Back to a first glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

CHORUS
And darling it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress we had this big wide city all to ourselves
We block the noise with the sound of “I need you”
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

Cause darling it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight I’m gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't want to dance
If I’m not dancing with you
Tonight I’m gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't want to dance
If I’m not dancing with you

It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight I’m gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't want to dance
If I’m not dancing with you
Tonight I’m gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't want to dance
If I’m not dancing with you

Lyrics:

You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ‘baby, I'm right here’ smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy

Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
“He said he'd be here…”

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick 
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

What do you say when tears are streaming down your face
in front of everyone you know?
And what do you do when the one who means the most to you
is the one who didn't show…?

You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
Happy birthday to you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh, I knew

You called me later
And said, “I'm sorry I didn't make it”
And I said, “I'm sorry, too”
And that was the moment I knew

Lyrics:

I know I’m probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn’t know
What he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
I wish it wasn’t 4am, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

CHORUS
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye 
Like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I know I’m probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word 
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy, oh I can hear it now
Talking down to me like I’d always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I’d run

REPEAT CHORUS
I hold onto this pride because these days it’s all I have
And I gave to you my best and we both know you can’t say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would’ve become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would’ve been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah

REPEAT CHORUS

We might still be in love, if you were a better man
Yeah, yeah
I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would’ve been the one
If you were a better man

Lyrics:

It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, ah ah, ah ah
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Ah ah, ah ah
Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It’s miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight’s the night when we forget about the deadlines, it’s time
Ah ah

CHORUS
I don't know about you
But I’m feeling 22
Everything will be alright if 
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I’ll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if 
We just keep dancing like we're...22, 22

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids (“Who is Taylor Swift anyway?”) 
Ah ah, ah ah
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping, yeah...
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It’s miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight’s the night when we forget about the heartbreaks, it’s time
Ah ah


REPEAT CHORUS
22, 22

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping 
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

REPEAT CHORUS
22, 22

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping 
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

Lyrics:

3am and I’m still awake
I bet you’re just fine, fast asleep in your city 
That’s better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I’ll bet your friends tell you she’s better than me
Huh

Well I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh they sit around talking ‘bout the meaning of life
And the book that just saved ‘em that I hadn’t heard of

But now that we’re done and it’s over
I bet you couldn’t believe 
When you realized I’m harder to forget
Than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

You grew up in a silver spoon gated community
Glamorous shiny bright Beverly Hills 
I was raised on a farm, no it wasn’t a mansion
Just living room dancing and kitchen table bills
But you know what they say
You can’t help who you fall for 
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we’re too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

Mr. Superior Thinking
Do you have all the space that you need?
I don’t have to be your shrink to know that
You’ll never be happy
And I bet you think about me 

I bet you think about me, yes, I bet
You think about me

Oh, block it all out
The voices so loud saying 
Why did you let her go
Does it make you feel sad 
That the love that you’re looking for
Is the love that you had

Now you’re out in the world, searching for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status 
Last time you felt free was when none of that shit mattered
Cause you were with me

But now that we’re done and it’s over
I bet it’s hard to believe
But it turned out I’m harder to forget 
Than I was to leave 
And, yeah, I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me  
I bet you think about me when you’re out 
At your cool indie music concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your million dollar couch
I bet you think about me when you say “oh my god
She’s insane, she wrote a song about me”
I bet you think about me

Lyrics:

I walked through the door with you 
The air was cold 
But somethin bout it felt like home somehow 
And I left my scarf there at your sister’s house 
And you’ve still got it in your drawer even now 
Oh your sweet disposition, and my wide eyed gaze 
We’re singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place 
And I can picture it after all these days 
And I know it’s long gone and that magic’s not here no more 
And I might be ok but I’m not fine at all…

Cause there we are again on that 
Little town street 
You almost ran the red 
Cause you were looking over at me 
Wind in my hair, I was there 
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter 
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses
in a twin-sized bed 
And your mother’s telling stories bout you on 
the tee ball team 
You taught me bout your past 
Thinkin your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys 
‘F*** the patriarchy’ keychain on the ground
We were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down
Any time now, he’s gonna say it’s love
You never called it what it was
til we were dead and gone and buried 
Check the pulse and come back 
Swearing it’s the same, after 3 months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to
As I reached for you but
All I felt was shame
And you held my lifeless frame 
And I know it’s long gone and 
There was nothing else I could do 
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to… 

Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We’re dancin round the kitchen in the 
refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well…
And there we are again 
When nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret
But I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we’d swear 
to remember it all too well 

Well maybe we got lost in translation 
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again 
Just to break me like a promise 
So casually cruel in the name of being honest 
I’m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all, all, all 
They say all’s well that ends well
But I’m in a new hell every time
You double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age
Maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die.

The idea you had of me
Who was she?
A never-needy, ever lovely jewel
Whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened
You.
That’s what happened: You.
You, who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you were on a late night show
But then he watched me watch the front door 
all night, willing you to come
And he said, “it’s supposed to be fun… 
Turning 21” 

Time won’t fly
It’s like I’m paralyzed by it 
I’d like to be my old self again
But I’m still trying to find it 
After plaid shirt days 
And nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things 
And I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence, and it smells like me 
You can’t get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well

Cause there we are again when
I loved you so 
Back before you lost the one real thing
You’ve ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there 
You remember it all 
Down the stairs, you were there 
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at telling jokes 
But the punchline goes:
“I’ll get older, but your lovers stay my age”
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I’m a soldier who’s returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
Cause in this city’s barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us did the love affair maim you 
All too well
Just between us, do you remember it 
All too well
Just between us, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair 
I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there
I was there
Sacred prayer
I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
All too well

Lyrics:

I’m walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time 

And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know...is don't let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room, and our slates are clean 
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
And I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same, oh
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

Lyrics:

(What about your promises, promises?)
(What about your promises, promises, promises?) 

What a shame 
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
Big mistake, broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made

I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said, “No one else” 
How could you do this, babe?

CHORUS
You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe

What a waste
Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe

I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
We said, “No one else” 
How could you do this, babe?

REPEAT CHORUS

Since you admitted it, I keep picturing
Her lips on your neck, I can't unsee it
I hate that because of you, I can't love you, babe
What a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away
How could you do this, babe?

REPEAT CHORUS

I'm here on the kitchen floor, you call but I won't hear it
You said, “No one else” 
We ain't getting through this one, babe
I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
You said, ""No one else”
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe

Lyrics:

New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a 60s queen
Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky...

CHORUS
And they'll tell you now
You’re the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now
You're the lucky one
But can you tell me now
You're the lucky one
Oh, oh, oh...

Now it's big black cars and riviera views 
And your lover in the foyer doesn’t even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky but you're so confused
Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place
Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive

REPEAT CHORUS


It was a few years later I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now...
Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

Let me tell you now
You're the lucky one
Let me tell you now 
You're the lucky one
Let me tell you now
You're the lucky one
Oh, oh, oh...

Yeah, they'll tell you now
You’re the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now
You're the lucky one
Bet you tell them now
You're the lucky one
Oh, oh, oh...oh, oh

Official Lyrics:
 
I’m five years old it’s getting cold I’ve got my big coat on 
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you I run and run 
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides look now the sky is gold 
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home 

I don’t know why all the trees change in the fall 
But I know you’re not scared of anything at all 
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away 
But I know I had the best day with you today 

I’m thirteen now and don’t know how my friends could be so mean
 I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys 
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away 
And we talk and window shop till I’ve forgotten all their names 

I don’t know who I’m gonna talk to now at school 
But I know I’m laughing on the car ride home with you 
Don’t know how long it’s gonna take to feel ok 
But I know I had the best day with you today 

I have an excellent father 
His strength is making me stronger 
God smiles on my little brother 
Inside and out he’s better than I am 

I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run 
And I had the best days with you 

There is a video I found from back when I was three 
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you’re talking to me 
It’s the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs 
Daddy’s smart and you’re the prettiest lady in the whole wide world 

Now I know why all the trees change in the fall 
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong 
And I love you for giving me your eyes 
For staying back and watching me shine and I didn't know if you knew 
So I’m taking this chance to say that I had the best day with you today

Official Lyrics:

It wasn’t just like a movie 
The rain didn’t soak through my clothes 
Down to my skin 
I’m driving away and I 
I guess you could say 
This is the last time 
I'll drive this way again 
Lost in the gray and I 
Try to grab at the fray cause I 
I still love you but I can’t 

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side 
Bye bye baby 
I want you bad but it’s come down to nothing 
And all I have is your sympathy 
Cause you took me home 
But you just couldn’t keep me 
Bye bye baby 
Bye bye baby 

The picture frame is empty 
On the dresser, vacant just like me 
I see your writing on the dash 
Then back to your hesitation 
I was so sure of everything 
Everything I thought we’d always have 

Guess I never doubted it 
Then the here and the now floods in 
Feels like I’m becoming 
A part of your past 

Repeat chorus 

There’s so much that I can’t touch 
You’re all I want but it’s not enough this time 
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands 
And I’m so scared 
Of how this ends 

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side 
Bye bye baby 
I want you bad but it’s come down to nothing 
And all I have is your sympathy 
Cause you took me home 
But you just couldn’t keep me 
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side 
Bye bye baby 
I want you bad but it’s come down to nothing 
And all I have is your sympathy 
Cause you took me home 
But you just couldn’t keep me 

Oh, you took me home 
I thought you were gonna keep me 
Bye bye baby 
Bye bye baby

Official Lyrics:

We used to walk along the streets
 When the porch lights were shining bright 
Before I had somewhere to be 
Back when we had all night 
And we were happy 
I do recall, a good while back 
We snuck into the circus 
You threw your arms around my neck 
Back when I deserved it 
And we were happy 

When it was good, baby 
It was good, baby 
We showed ‘em all up 
No one could touch the way we 
Laughed in the dark 
Talking ‘bout your daddy’s farm 
We were gonna buy someday 
And we were happy 

We used to watch the sun go down 
On the boats in the water 
That’s sorta how I feel right now 
And goodbye’s so much harder 
Cause we were happy 

Repeat chorus 
We were happy 

Oh, I hate those voices 
Telling me I’m not in love anymore 
But they don’t give me choices 
And that’s what these tears are for 
Cause we were happy 
We were happy 

When it was good, baby 
It was good, baby 
We showed ‘em all up 
No one could touch the way we 
Laughed in the dark 
Talking ‘bout your daddy’s farm 
And you were gonna marry me 
And we were happy 
We were happy 
Oh, we were happy

Official Lyrics:
 
I see your face in my mind as I drive away 
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way 
People are people and sometimes we change our minds 
But it’s killing me to see you go after all this time 

Mmm . . . mmm . . . mmm . . . mmm . . . mmm . . . mmm . . . 
Mmm . . . mmm . . . mmm . . . mmm . . . mmm . . . mmm . . . 

Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie 
It’s the kinda ending you don’t really wanna see 
Cause it’s tragedy and it’ll only bring you down 
Now I don’t know what to be without you around 

And we know it’s never simple, never easy 
Never a clean break, no one here to save me 
You’re the only thing I know like the back of my hand 
And I can’t breathe without you, but I have to 
Breathe without you, but I have to 

Never wanted this, never want to see you hurt 
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve 
But people are people and sometimes it doesn’t work out 
And nothing we say is gonna save us from the fallout 

Repeat chorus 

It’s 2am, feeling like I just lost a friend 
Hope you know it’s not easy, easy for me 
It’s 2am, feeling like I just lost a friend 
I hope you know this ain’t easy, easy for me 

And we know it’s never simple, never easy 
Never a clean break, no one here to save me 
Oh, I can’t breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to 
Breathe without you, but I have to 

I’m sorry
I’m sorry 
I’m sorry 
I’m sorry 
I’m sorry
I’m sorry 
I’m sorry

Official Lyrics:

Today was a fairytale 
You were the prince 
I used to be a damsel in distress 
You took me by the hand 
And you picked me up at six 
Today was a fairytale 

Today was a fairytale 

Today was a fairytale 

I wore a dress 
You wore a dark grey t-shirt 
You told me I was pretty 
When I looked like a mess 
Today was a fairytale 

Time slows down 
Whenever you’re around 

But can you feel this magic in the air? 
It must have been the way you kissed me 
Fell in love when I saw you standing there 
It must have been the way 
Today was a fairytale 
It must have been the way 
Today was a fairytale 

Today was a fairytale 
You’ve got a smile 
That takes me to another planet 
Every move you make 
Everything you say is right 
Today was a fairytale 

Today was a fairytale 
All that I can say 
Is now it’s getting so much clearer 
Nothing made sense 
Till the time I saw your face 
Today was a fairytale 

Time slows down 
Whenever you’re around, yeah 

But can you feel this magic in the air?
 It must have been the way you kissed me 
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
 It must have been the way 
Today was a fairytale 
It must have been the way 
Today was a fairytale 

Time slows down 
Whenever you’re around 
I can feel my heart 
It’s beating in my chest 
Did you feel it? 
I can’t put this down 
But can you feel this magic in the air? 
It must have been the way you kissed me 
Fell in love when I saw you standing there 
It must have been the way 

But can you feel this magic in the air? 
It must have been the way you kissed me 
Fell in love when I saw you standing there 
It must have been the way 
Today was a fairytale 
It must have been the way 
Today was a fairytale 

Oh, oh, yeah, oh 
Today was a fairytale

Official Lyrics:
 
Well it’s a sad picture, the final blow hits you 
Somebody else gets what you wanted again 
You know it’s all the same, another time and place 
Repeating history and you’re getting sick of it 
But I believe in whatever you do 
And I’ll do anything to see it through 

Because these things will change
 Can you feel it now? 
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come 
For us to finally win 
And we’ll sing hallelujah, we’ll sing hallelujah 
Oh, oh 

So we’ve been outnumbered 
Raided and now cornered 
It’s hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair 
We’re getting stronger now 
Find things they never found 
They might be bigger 
But we’re faster and never scared 
You can walk away, say we don’t need this 
But there’s something in your eyes 
Says we can beat this 

Repeat chorus 

Tonight we’ll stand, get off our knees 
Fight for what we’ve worked for all these years 
And the battle was long, it’s the fight of our lives 
But we’ll stand up champions tonight 

It was the night things changed 
Can you see it now? 
When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down 
It’s a revolution, throw your hands up 
Cause we never gave in 
And we’ll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah 
Hallelujah

Official Lyrics:

I like the way you sound in the morning 
We’re on the phone and without a warning 
I realize your laugh is the best sound I have ever heard 
I like the way I can’t keep my focus 
I watch you talk, you didn’t notice 
I hear the words but all I can think is we should be together 

Every time you smile, I smile 
And every time you shine, I’ll shine for you 

Whoa I’m feeling you baby 
Don’t be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me 
Baby I’m never gonna leave you 
Say that you wanna be with me too 
Cause I’m gonna stay through it all so jump then fall 

Well I like the way your hair falls in your face 
You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face 
Oh I’ve never been so wrapped up honey 
I like the way you’re everything I’ve ever wanted 
I had time to think it over and all I can say is come closer 
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me 

Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I’ll shine for you 

Repeat chorus 

The bottom’s gonna drop out from under our feet
I’ll catch you, I’ll catch you 
When people say things that bring you to your knees, I’ll catch you 
The time is gonna come when you’re so mad you could cry 
But I’ll hold you through the night until you smile 

Whoa I need you baby 
Don’t be afraid please jump then fall, jump then fall into me 
Baby I’m never gonna leave you 
Say that you wanna be with me too 
Cause I’m gonna stay through it all so jump then fall 
Jump then fall baby 
Jump then fall into me, into me 

And every time you smile, I smile 
And every time you shine, I’ll shine 
And every time you’re here baby I’ll show you 
I’ll show you you can jump then fall 
Jump then fall Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah

Official Lyrics:
 
I took a chance, I took a shot 
And you might think I’m bulletproof, but I’m not 
You took a swing, I took it hard 
And down here from the ground I see who you are 

I’m sick and tired of your attitude 
I’m feeling like I don’t know you 
You tell me that you love me then cut me down 
And I need you like a heartbeat 
But you know you got a mean streak 
Makes me run for cover when you’re around 
Here’s to you and your temper 
Yes, I remember what you said last night 
I know that you see what you’re doing to me 
Tell me why 

Well you could write a book on how to ruin someone’s perfect day 
Well I get so confused and frustrated 
Forget what I’m trying to say, oh 

I’m sick and tired of your reasons 
I got no one to believe in 
You tell me that you want me, then push me around 
And I need you like a heartbeat 
But you know you got a mean streak 
Makes me run for cover when you’re around 
Here’s to you and your temper 
Yes, I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what you’re doing to me 
Tell me why 

Why…do you have to make me feel small 
So you can feel whole inside? 
Why…do you have to put down my dreams 
So you’re the only thing on my mind? 

Well, I’m sick and tired of your attitude 
Feeling like I don’t know you 
You tell me that you want me then cut me down 
I’m sick and tired of your reasons 
I’ve got no one to believe in 
You ask me for my love then you push me around 
Here’s to you and your temper 
Yes, I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what you’re doing to me 
Tell me why 
Why, tell me why, oh 

I take a step back, let you go 
I told you I’m not bulletproof 
Now you know

Official Lyrics:
 
Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving but I know I saw a light in you 
And as we walked we were talking I didn’t say half the things I wanted to 
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window I’ll be the one waiting there even when it’s cold Hey Stephen, boy you might have me believing 
I don’t always have to be alone 

Cause I can’t help it if you look like an angel 
Can’t help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so 
Come feel this magic I’ve been feeling since I met you 
Can’t help it if there’s no one else 
I can’t help myself 

Hey Stephen, I’ve been holding back this feeling so I’ve got some things to say to you 
I’ve seen it all so I thought but I never seen nobody shine the way you do 
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name 
It’s beautiful, wonderful don’t you ever change 
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving I think you and I should stay the same 

Repeat chorus 

They’re dimming the street lights, you’re perfect for me why aren’t you here tonight 
I’m waiting alone now so come on and come out and pull me near 
And shine, shine, shine 

Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons why I should be the one you choose 
All those other girls, well they’re beautiful but would they write a song for you 

I can’t help it if you look like an angel 
Can’t help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I’ve been feeling since I met you 
Can’t help it if there’s no one else 
I can’t help myself

If you look like an angel 
Can’t help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so 
Come feel this magic I’ve been feeling since I met you 
Can’t help it if there’s no one else 
I can’t help myself 
Myself, can’t help myself 
I can’t help myself

Official Lyrics:

Once upon a time 
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye 
And we caught onto something 
I hold onto the night 
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me 

Were you just kidding? 
Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down 
We almost never speak 
I don't feel welcome anymore 
Baby what happened, please tell me 

Cause one second it was perfect 
Now you're halfway out the door 
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called 
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all 
And you flash back to when he said forever and always 
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom 
Everything is wrong 
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 
Cause I was there when you said forever and always 

Was I out of line? 
Did I say something way too honest? 
Made you run and hide Like a scared little boy 
I looked into your eyes 
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure 
So here's to everything coming down to nothing 
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core 
Where is this going? 
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore 

Repeat chorus 

You didn't mean it baby 
I don't think so 

Oh back up, baby, back up 
Did you forget everything? 
Back up, baby, back up 
Did you forget everything? 

Cause it rains in your bedroom 
Everything is wrong 
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 
Cause I was there when you said forever and always 

Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called 
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all 
And you flash back to when we said forever and always 
And it rains in your bedroom 
Everything is wrong 
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 
Cause I was there when you said forever and always 
You didn’t mean it baby 
You said forever and always, yeah

Official Lyrics:
 
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors 
It’s the morning of your very first day 
You say hi to your friends you ain’t seen in a while 
Try and stay out of everybody’s way 
It’s your freshman year and you’re gonna be here 
For the next four years in this town 
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say 
You know I haven’t seen you around, before 

Cause when you’re fifteen and 
Somebody tells you they love you 
You’re gonna believe them 
And when you’re fifteen, feeling like 
There’s nothing to figure out 
Well count to ten, take it in 
This is life before you know 
Who you’re gonna be 
At fifteen 

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail 
And soon enough you’re best friends 
Laughing at the other girls who think they’re so cool 
We’ll be out of here as soon as we can 
And then you’re on your very first date and he’s got a car 
And you’re feeling like flying 
And your mama’s waiting up and you’re thinking he’s the one 
And you’re dancing ‘round your room when the night ends 
When the night ends

Cause when you’re fifteen and 
Somebody tells you they love you 
You’re gonna believe them 
And when you’re fifteen and your first kiss 
Makes your head spin around well 
In your life you’ll do things greater than 
Dating the boy on the football team 
I didn’t know it at fifteen 

When all you wanted was to be wanted 
Wish you could go back 
And tell yourself what you know now 

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday 
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine 
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy 
Who changed his mind 
And we both cried 

Cause when you’re fifteen and 
Somebody tells you they love you 
You’re gonna believe them 
And when you’re fifteen, don’t forget to look before you fall 
But I’ve found time can heal most anything 
And you just might find who you’re supposed to be 
I didn’t know who I was supposed to be 
At fifteen 

La la la la la La la la la la 
La la la la la 

Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl 
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

Official Lyrics:
 
You’re on the phone with your girlfriend 
She’s upset, she’s going off about something that you said 
Cause she doesn’t get your humor like I do 

I’m in my room it’s a typical Tuesday night
I’m listening to the kind of music she doesn’t like 
And she’ll never know your story like I do 

Cause she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts 
She’s cheer captain and I’m on the bleachers 
Dreaming ‘bout the day when you wake up and find 
That what you’re looking for has been here the whole time 

If you could see that I’m the one who understands you 
Been here all along so why can’t you see 
You belong with me
 You belong with me 

Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans 
I can’t help thinking this is how it ought to be 
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself, hey isn’t this easy 

And you’ve got a smile that could light up this whole town 
I haven’t seen it in a while since she brought you down 
You say you’re fine I know you better than that 
Hey what you doing with a girl like that 

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers 
She’s cheer captain and I’m on the bleachers 
Dreaming ‘bout the day when you wake up and find 
That what you’re looking for has been here the whole time 

If you could see that I’m the one who understands you 
Been here all along so why can’t you see 
You belong with me 
Standing by waiting at your back door 
All this time how could you not know baby 
You belong with me 
You belong with me 

Oh I remember you driving to my house in the middle of the night 
I’m the one who makes you laugh when you know you’re ‘bout to cry 
I know your favorite songs and you tell me about your dreams 
I think I know where you belong, I think I know it’s with me 

Can’t you see that I’m the one who understands you 
Been here all along so why can’t you see 
You belong with me 
Standing by waiting at your back door 
All this time how could you not know baby 
You belong with me 
You belong with me 
You belong with me 
Have you ever thought just maybe 
You belong with me 
You belong with me

Official Lyrics:

Hey
I knew I’d run into you somewhere 
It’s been a while, I didn’t mean to stare 
I heard she’s nothing like me 
I’m sure she’ll make you happy 

But don’t you 
Don’t you smile at me and ask me how I’ve been 
Don’t you say you’ve missed me if you don’t want me again 
You don’t know how much I feel I love you still 
So why don’t you 
Don’t you 

Sometimes 
I really wish that I could hate you 
I’ve tried 
But that’s just something I can’t do 
My heart knows what the truth is 
I swore I wouldn’t do this 

Repeat chorus 

So I’ll walk out of here tonight 
Tried to go on with my life 
And you can say we’re still friends 
But I don’t want to pretend 
So if I see you again 

Repeat chorus 
Don’t you

I could go back to every laugh 
But I don’t wanna go there anymore 
And I know all the steps up to your door 
But I don’t wanna go there anymore 

Talk to the wind, talk to the sky 
Talk to the man with the reasons why 
And let me know what you find 
I’ll leave my window open 
Cause I’m too tired at night to call your name 
Just know I’m right here hoping 
That you’ll come in with the rain 

I could stand up and sing you a song 
But I don’t wanna have to go that far 
And I, I’ve got you down 
I know you by heart and you don’t even know where I start 

Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
 Talk to the man who put you here 
And don’t wait for the sky to clear 

I’ll leave my window open 
Cause I’m too tired at night to call your name 
Just know I’m right here hoping 
That you’ll come in with the rain 

I’ve watched you so long, screamed your name 
I don’t know what else I can say 

I’ll leave my window open 
Cause I’m too tired at night for all these games 
Just know I’m right here hoping 
That you’ll come in with the rain 

I could go back to every laugh 
But I don’t wanna go there anymore

Official Lyrics:

This is wrong but I can’t help but feel like 
There ain’t nothin’ more right babe 
Misty morning comes again and I can’t 
Help but wish I could see your face 
I knew from the first note played 
I’d be breaking all my rules to see you 
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row 
Scream your name 

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like 
I can’t keep my eyes off of you 
I’m no one special, just another wide eyed girl 
Who’s desperately in love with you
 Give me a photograph to hang on my wall 
Superstar 

Morning loneliness 
Comes around when I’m not dreaming about you 
But when my world wakes up today 
You’ll be in another town 
And I knew when I saw your face 
I’d be counting down the ways to see you 
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row 
Scream your name 

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like 
I can’t take my eyes off of you 
I’m no one special, just another wide eyed girl 
Who’s desperately in love with you 
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall 
Superstar 

You played in bars, you play guitar 
I’m invisible and everyone knows who you are 
And you’ll never see you sing me to sleep 
Every night from the radio 

Repeat 2nd chorus 
Sweet, sweet superstar 
Superstar

Official Lyrics:
 
I’m five years old it’s getting cold I’ve got my big coat on 
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you I run and run 
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides look now the sky is gold 
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home 

I don’t know why all the trees change in the fall 
But I know you’re not scared of anything at all 
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away 
But I know I had the best day with you today 

I’m thirteen now and don’t know how my friends could be so mean
 I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys 
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away 
And we talk and window shop till I’ve forgotten all their names 

I don’t know who I’m gonna talk to now at school 
But I know I’m laughing on the car ride home with you 
Don’t know how long it’s gonna take to feel ok 
But I know I had the best day with you today 

I have an excellent father 
His strength is making me stronger 
God smiles on my little brother 
Inside and out he’s better than I am 

I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run 
And I had the best days with you 

There is a video I found from back when I was three 
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you’re talking to me 
It’s the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs 
Daddy’s smart and you’re the prettiest lady in the whole wide world 

Now I know why all the trees change in the fall 
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong 
And I love you for giving me your eyes 
For staying back and watching me shine and I didn't know if you knew 
So I’m taking this chance to say that I had the best day with you today

Official Lyrics:
 
There’s something ‘bout the way 
The street looks when it’s just rained 
There’s a glow off the pavement 
You walk me to the car 
And you know I want to ask you to dance right there 
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah 
Oh, yeah 

We’re driving down the road 
I wonder if you know 
I’m trying so hard not to get caught up now 
But you’re just so cool, run your hands through your hair 
Absentmindedly makin’ me want you 

And I don’t know how it gets better than this 
You take my hand and drag me headfirst 
Fearless 
And I don’t know why but with you I’d dance 
In a storm in my best dress 
Fearless 

So baby drive slow till we run out of road 
In this one-horse town, I wanna stay right here 
In this passenger seat 
You put your eyes on me In this moment now 
Capture it, remember it 

Repeat chorus 
Oh, oh 

Well you stood there with me in the doorway 
My hands shake, I’m not usually this way but 
You pull me in and I’m a little more brave 
It’s a first kiss, it’s flawless, really something 
It’s fearless 
Oh, yeah 

Repeat chorus 
Repeat chorus
 
Oh, oh 
Oh, yeah

Official Lyrics:
 
He is sensible and so incredible 
And all my single friends are jealous 
He says everything I need to hear and it's like 
I couldn't ask for anything better 
He opens up my door and I get into his car 
And he says you look beautiful tonight 
And I feel perfectly fine 

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
And it’s 2am and I'm cursing your name 
So in love that you act insane 
And that's the way I loved you 
Breaking down and coming undone 
It's a roller coaster kinda rush A
nd I never knew I could feel that much
And that’s the way I loved you 

He respects my space 
And never makes me wait 
And he calls exactly when he says he will 
He's close to my mother 
Talks business with my father 
He's charming and endearing 
And I'm comfortable 

Repeat chorus 

He can't see the smile I'm faking 
And my heart's not breaking 
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all 
And you were wild and crazy 
Just so frustrating intoxicating 
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name 
So in love that I acted insane 
And that's the way I loved you 
Breaking down and coming undone 
It's a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh 
And that’s the way I loved you oh, oh 
Never knew I could feel that much 
That's the way I loved you

Official Lyrics:

In the heat of the fight, I walked away 
Ignoring words that you were saying 
Trying to make me stay 
I said this time, I’ve had enough 
And you’ve called a hundred times 
But I’m not picking up 
Cause I’m so mad, I might tell you that it’s over 
But if you look a little closer 

I said leave, but all I really want is you 
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles 
Screaming I’m in love with you 
Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more 
And don’t you leave, cause I know all I need 
Is on the other side of the door 

Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone 
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone 
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door 
And all the things that I misread 
So babe, if you know everything 
Tell me why you couldn’t see 
When I left I wanted you to chase after me, yeah 

Repeat chorus 

And I’ll scream out the window 
I can’t even look at you 
I don’t need you, but I do, I do, I do 
I’ll say there’s nothing you can say 
To make this right again 
I mean it . . . I mean it 
What I mean is 

I said leave, but baby all I want is you 
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles 
Screaming I’m in love with you 
Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more 
And don’t you leave, cause I know all I need 
Is on the other side of the door 

With your face and the beautiful eyes 
And the conversation with the little white lies 
And the faded picture of a beautiful night, you 
Carried me from your car up the stairs 
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess 
After everything and that little black dress 
After everything I must confess I need you

Official Lyrics:
 
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around 
I’ve been giving out chances every time 
And all you do is let me down 
And it’s taken me this long baby but I figured you out 
And you’re thinking we’ll be fine again but not this time around 

You don’t have to call anymore 
I won’t pick up the phone 
This is the last straw 
Don’t wanna to hurt anymore 
And you can tell me that you’re sorry 
But I don’t believe you baby 
Like I did before 
You’re not sorry. . .no, no, no, no 

You’re looking so innocent
 I might believe you if I didn’t know 
Could’ve loved you all my life 
If you hadn’t left me waiting in the cold 
And you got your share of secrets 
And I’m tired of being last to know 
And now you’re asking me to listen cause it’s worked each time before 

But you don’t have to call anymore I won’t pick up the phone 
This is the last straw 
Don’t wanna hurt anymore 
And you can tell me that you’re sorry 
But I don’t believe you baby 
Like I did before 
You’re not sorry. . .no, no 
You’re not sorry. . .no, no 

You had me crawling for you honey 
And it never would’ve gone away no 
You used to shine so bright but I watched all of it fade 

So you don’t have to call anymore 
I won’t pick up the phone 
This is the last straw 
There’s nothing left to beg for 
And you can tell me that you’re sorry 
But I don’t believe you baby 
Like I did before 
You’re not sorry. . .no, no 
You’re not sorry. . .no, no 
No, no, no, no 
No, no, no, no 
No, no, no, no

Official Lyrics:

Untouchable like a distant diamond sky 
I’m reaching out and I just can't tell you why 
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you 
Untouchable burning brighter than the sun 
And when you're close I feel like coming undone 

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream 
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name 
You gotta c’mon c’mon 
Say that we'll be together 
C’mon c’mon 
Little taste of heaven 

It's half full and I won't wait here all day 
I know you’re saying that you'd be here anyway 
But you’re untouchable burning brighter than the sun 
And now that you're close I feel like coming undone

 In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream 
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name 
You gotta c’mon c’mon 
Say that we’ll be together 
C’mon c’mon, oh 

In the middle of the night waking from this dream 
I wanna feel you by my side standing next to me 
You gotta c’mon c’mon 
Say that we'll be together 
C’mon c’mon 
Little taste of heaven 

I’m caught up in you, oh, oh 

But you’re untouchable burning brighter than the sun 
Now that you're close I feel like coming undone 

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream 
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name 
You gotta c’mon c’mon 
Say that we’ll be together 
C’mon c’mon, oh 

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream 
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name 
You gotta c’mon c’mon 
Say that we’ll be together 
C’mon c’mon 
C’mon 

In the middle of the night waking from this dream 
I wanna feel you by my side standing next to me 
You gotta c’mon c’mon 
Say that we'll be together 
C’mon c’mon 
Little taste of heaven 

And in the middle of the night when I'm in this dream 
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name 
You gotta c’mon c’mon, oh 
C’mon c’mon 
C’mon c’mon, oh oh oh oh 

It’s like a million little stars spelling out your name 
Spelling out your name, oh

Official Lyrics:
 
Say you’re sorry, that face of an angel 
Comes out just when you need it to 
As I paced back and forth all this time 
Cause I honestly believed in you 
Holding on the days drag on 
Stupid girl, I should’ve known 
I should’ve known, that 

I’m not a princess, this ain’t a fairytale 
I’m not the one you’ll sweep off her feet 
Lead her up the stairwell 
This ain’t Hollywood, this is a small town 
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down 
Now it’s too late for you and your white horse 
To come around 

Maybe I was naïve, got lost in your eyes 
And never really had a chance 
Well, my mistake, I didn’t know to be in love 
You had to fight to have the upper hand 
I had so many dreams about you and me 
Happy endings, well now I know 

Repeat chorus 

And there you are on your knees 
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me 
Just like I always wanted, but I’m so sorry. . . 

Cause I’m not your princess, this ain’t our fairytale 
I’m gonna find someone someday 
Who might actually treat me well 
This is a big world, that was a small town 
There in my rearview mirror disappearing now 
And it’s too late for you and your white horse 
Now it’s too late for you and your white horse 
To catch me now 

Oh, try and catch me now 
Oh, it’s too late to catch me now

Official Lyrics:

You said, “I know” 
When I said, “I need some time, need some space 
To think about all of this” 
And you watched me go 
And I knew my words were hard to hear 
And harder to ever take back 
And I said, 
“When can I come back?” 
And you said 

That’s when 
When I wake up in the morning 
That’s when 
When it’s sunny or storming 
Laughing, when I’m crying 
And that’s when 
I’ll be waiting at the front gate 
That’s when 
When I see your face 
I’ll let you in 
And baby that’s when 

I said, “I know” 
When you said, “I did you wrong 
Made mistakes, and put you through all of this” 
Then through the phone 
Came all your tears 
And I said, “Leave those all in our past” 
And you said, “When can I come back?”
And I said 

Repeat chorus 

And you said, “Honestly, 
When you were gone 
Did you ever think of me?” 
And I said 
That’s when 
When I woke up in the morning 
That’s when 
It was sunny or storming 
Laughing 
When I was crying 
And that’s when you were waiting at the front gate 
That’s when, when I saw your face 
You let me in, and baby that’s when 

When I’m laughing 
When I’m crying 

That’s when I miss you 
That’s when I want you 
That’s when I love you 
That’s when

Official Lyrics:
 
Mr. perfect face
Mr. here to stay
Mr. looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away
Everything was right
Mr. I’ve been waiting for you all my life
Mr. every single day until the end I will be by your side
But that was when I got to know
Mr. change of heart
Mr. leaves me all alone
I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it’s wonderful to see that you’re okay

Hello, Mr. perfectly fine
How’s your heart after breaking mine?
Mr. always at the right place at the right time, baby
Hello, Mr. casually cruel
Mr. everything revolves around you
I’ve been Miss misery since your goodbye
And you’re Mr. perfectly fine

Mr. never told me why
Mr. never had to see me cry
Mr. insincere apology so he doesn’t look like the bad guy
He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even heard my name
Well I thought you might be different than the rest
I guess you’re all the same
Because I hear he’s got his arm ‘round a brand new girl
I’ve been picking up my heart
He’s been picking up her
And I never got past what you put me through
But it’s wonderful to see that it never phased you

Repeat chorus

So dignified in your well pressed suit
So strategized
All the eyes on you
Sashay your way to your seat
It’s the best seat
In the best room
Oh, he’s so smug
Mr. always wins
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything

And it’s really such a shame
It’s such a shame
Cause I was Miss here to stay
Now I’m Miss gonna be alright someday
And someday maybe you’ll miss me
But by then you’ll be Mr. too late

Goodbye, Mr. perfectly fine
How’s your heart after breaking mine?
Mr. always at the right place at the right time, baby
Goodbye, Mr. casually cruel
Mr. everything revolves around you
I’ve been Miss misery for the last time
And you’re Mr. perfectly fine
You’re perfectly fine
Mr. look me in the eye and tell me you

Official Lyrics:

Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones, on old county roads
They leave ‘em muddy underneath 
Reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off 
It's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket that's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been
Reminds me of me

I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long
And wasted time, lost tears 
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I’ve still got you all over me

The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your ‘don't you wish you had me’ grin
But I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then

And I lived, and I learned 
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long
And wasted time, lost tears 
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I’ve still got you all over me

I lived, and I learned 
And found out what it was to turn around
And see, that we 
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried 
And I watched a part of myself die
Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I’ve still got you all over me
I’ve still got you all over me
Still got you all over me

exile feat. bon iver - lyrics:
written by taylor swift, william bowery & justin vernon

I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughing but the joke’s not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holding all this love out here in the hall

I think I’ve seen this film before
And I didn’t like the ending
You’re not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town
Now I’m in exile seeing you out
I think I’ve seen this film before

I can see you staring, honey
Like he’s just your understudy
Like you’d get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancing on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

I think I’ve seen this film before
And I didn’t like the ending
I’m not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown
Now I’m in exile seeing you out
I think I’ve seen this film before
So I’m leaving out the side door

So step right out
There is no amount
Of crying I can do for you

All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn’t even hear me out
(Didn’t even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign
(I gave so many signs)

All this time
I never learned to read your mind
(Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn’t turn things around
(You never turned things around)
Cause you never gave a warning sign
(I gave so many signs)
(So many signs)
(So many signs)
You didn’t even see the signs

I think I’ve seen this film before
And I didn’t like the ending
You’re not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town
Now I’m in exile seeing you out
I think I’ve seen this film before

So I’m leaving out the side door

Our 'Footnotes' series fills in fans on the particulars of its videos, and in the best cases, reveals a few secrets, too. That was the case when we connected with Taylor Swift for info regarding the writing and shooting of ""cardigan"" from her new 'folklore' album - she really dug deep to give us the goods. This episode is teeming with narrative details. Watch closely and learn about TS's grandfather, her painting skills, the songs' relationship to each other, and the clever plot device that serves as a very resonant metaphor. Taylor had a lot in mind when she was directing the vid, and there's PLENTY to be absorbed in this edition of Footnotes. Share it with a pal.

Official ‘cardigan’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Aaron Dessner

Vintage tee, brand new phone High heels on cobblestones
When you are young they assume you know nothing Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young they assume you know nothing

But I knew you Dancing in your Levi’s
Drunk under a streetlight I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt Baby kiss it better
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone’s bed You put me on and said I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and Giving me your weekends I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line Once in twenty lifetimes
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone’s bed You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars But now I’m bleeding

Cause I knew you Stepping on the last train
 
Marked me like a bloodstain I knew you
Tried to change the ending Peter losing Wendy
I knew you
Leaving like a father Running like water
When you are young they assume you know nothing But I knew you’d linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you’d haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I’d curse you for the longest time Chasing shadows in the grocery line
I knew you’d miss me once the thrill expired And you’d be standing in my front porch light And I knew you’d come back to me
You’d come back to me And you’d come back to me And you’d come back
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan Under someone’s bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

Official ‘Cornelia Street’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift

We were in the backseat
drunk on something stronger
than the drinks in the bar
I rent a place on Cornelia Street,
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
ﬁlling in the blanks as we go
As if the streetlights pointed in an arrowhead
leading us home And I hope I never lose you
Hope it never ends
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
That’s the kind of heartbreak
Time could never mend
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby I get mystiﬁed by how
this city screams your name
And baby I’m so terriﬁed of if you ever walk away
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again Windows ﬂung right open
Autumn air, jacket round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the ﬂoor
Back when we were card sharks
Playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone
But then you called
Showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I Chorus You hold my hand
On the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion
Listen... I hope I never lose you 
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again 
Never again
And baby I get mystiﬁed by how
this city screams your name
And baby I’m so terriﬁed of if you ever walk away
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
I rent a place on Cornelia Street,
I say casually in the car

Official ‘Death By A Thousand Cuts’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Jack Antonoff

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk but it’s not enough ‘cause
The morning comes and
You’re not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier’s still flickering here
‘Cause I can’t pretend it’s ok when it’s not
It’s death by a thousand cuts I dress to kill my time
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it’ll be all right
They say ‘I don’t know’
And what once was ours
Is no one’s now
I see you everywhere
The only thing we share
is this small town
You said it was a great love
One for the ages
If the story’s over
Why am I still writing pages? Chorus My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Trying to find a part of me that you didn’t touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I’m searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, United we stand
Our country
Guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Trying to find a part of me you didn’t take up
Gave you too much but it wasn’t enough
But I’ll be all right
It’s just a thousand cuts I get drunk but it’s not enough ‘cause
You’re not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier’s still flickering here
‘Cause I can’t pretend it’s ok when it’s not
No it’s not
It’s death by a thousand cuts
Trying to find a part of me that you didn’t touch
My body, my love
But it wasn’t enough, it wasn’t enough, no, no I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it’ll be all right
They say ‘I don’t know’

Official ‘Daylight’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift 

My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I’ve crossed unforgiven
I’ll tell you the truth but never goodbye I don’t wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don’t wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I’ve been sleeping so long in a twenty year dark night
And now I see daylight
I only see daylight Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it’s morning now
It’s brighter now, now Chorus And I can still see it all in my mind
All of you, all of me intertwined
I once believed love would be black and white
But it’s golden And I can still see it all in my head
Back and forth from New York
Sneaking in your bed
I once believed love would be burning red
But it’s golden
Like daylight I don’t wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I could never look away
I don’t wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Things will never be the same
I’ve been sleeping so long in a twenty year dark night
And now I see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight
Like daylight
It’s golden
Like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight
And let it go
Just let it go
Let it go Spoken: 
“I want to be defined by the things that I love. Not the things I hate, not the things I’m afraid of, the things that haunt me in the middle of the night. I just think that... you are what you love.”

fficial lyrics for ""The Archer"" 
written by Taylor Swift

Combat
I'm ready for combat
I saw I don't want that
But what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown out speeches I almost said to you
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train
I ride off alone
I never grew up,
It's getting so old
Help me hold onto you
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?
Dark side
I search for your dark side
But what if I'm all right, right, right, right here?
And i cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then hate my reflection for years and years
I wake in the night
I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire
Invisible smoke
And all my heroes
Die all alone
Help me hold onto you
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Screaming who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?

'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through me
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies
Started out friends
Help me hold onto you
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay
Combat
I'm ready for combat

Official “Lover” Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift

We could leave the Christmas lights up 
‘Til January
This is our place, we make the rules 
And there’s a dazzling haze
A mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close? 
Forever and ever
Take me out
And take me home
You’re my, my, my, my... 
Lover
We could let our friends crash 
In the living room
This is our place, we make the call 
And I’m highly suspicious
That everyone who sees you wants you 
I’ve loved you 3 summers now, honey 
But I want them all
Chorus
Ladies and gentlemen
Will you please stand
With every guitar string scar on my hand 
I take this magnetic force of a man
To be my lover
My heart’s been borrowed 
And yours has been blue 
All’s well that ends well 
To end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true 
To my lover
And you’ll save all your dirtiest jokes 
For me
And at every table, I’ll save you a seat 
Lover...
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever
Take me out
And take me home
You’re my, my, my, my... 
Oh you’re my, my, my, my... 
Darling you’re my, my, my, my...
Lover

►Official ‘The Man’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Joel Little

I would be complex 
I would be cool
They’d say I played the ﬁeld before I found someone to commit to 
And that would be ok
For me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you 
I’d be a fearless leader
I’d be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya 
What’s that like? I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man
And I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...
Then I’d be the man 
I’d be the man
I’d be the man They’d say I hustled 
Put in the work
They wouldn’t shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve 
What I was wearing
If I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
And they would toast to me, oh
Let the players play
I’d be just like Leo
In Saint-Tropez Chorus What’s it like to brag about 
Raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models 
And it’s all good if you’re bad 
And it’s okay if you’re mad If I was out ﬂashing my dollars 
I’d be a bitch, not a baller 
They paint me out to be bad 
So it’s okay that I’m mad I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man
I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...
Then I’d be the man 
I’d be the man
I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man
And I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...
Then I’d be the man 
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
If I was a man
I’d be the man

""Christmas Tree Farm"" Lyrics by Taylor Swift:

My winter nights are taken up by static, stress and holiday shopping traffic 
But I close my eyes and I’m somewhere else - just like magic...

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow 
And I just wanna be there tonight 
Sweet dreams 
Of holly and ribbon 
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there, too 
Under the mistletoe 
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, I love you 
Just being in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm 
There’s a light in the barn 
We’d run inside out from the cold 
In the town kids are dreaming of sleighs
And they’re warm and they’re safe 
They wake to see a blanket of snow 
Sweet dreams 
Of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there, too
Under the mistletoe 
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, I love you 
Just being in your arms 
Takes me back to that little farm 
Where every wish comes true
Oh baby, yeah
And when I’m feeling alone
You remind me of home
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn’t fair
I pretend that we’re there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas…to you
Under the mistletoe…to you
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, I love you 

Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
May your every wish come true

I love you

►Official Lover REMIX feat. Shawn Mendes Lyrics:

We could leave the Christmas lights up 
‘Til January
This is our place, we make the rules 
And there’s a dazzling haze
A mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close? 
Forever and ever
Take me out
And take me home
You’re my, my, my, my... 
Lover

We could light a bunch of candles and dance around the kitchen, baby
Pictures of when we were young 
Would hang on the wall
We would sit on the stoop 
I’ll sing love songs to you when we’re eighty
See I finally got you now, honey
I won’t let you fall

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close? 
Forever and ever
Take me out
And take me home
You’re my, my, my, my... 
Lover

Ladies and gentlemen
Will you please stand
With every guitar string scar on my hand 
I take this magnetic force of a man
To be my lover

Look in my eyes, they will tell you the truth 
The girl in my story, has always been you
I’d go down with the Titanic, it’s true 
For you… 
Lover

And you’ll save all your dirtiest jokes 
For me
And at every table, I’ll save you a seat 
Lover…

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever
Take me out
And take me home
You’re my, my, my, my... 
Oh you’re my, my, my, my... 
Darling you’re my, my, my, my...
Lover

Official “False God” Lyrics

Written by Taylor Swift & Jack Antonoff

We were crazy to think

Crazy to think that this could work

Remember how I said I’d die for you

We were stupid to jump

In the ocean separating us

Remember how I’d ﬂy to you

And I can’t talk to you when you’re like this

Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town - I’m New York City

I still do it for you babe

They all warned us about times like this

They say the road gets hard and you

get lost when you’re led by blind faith

Blind faith But we might just get away with it

Religion’s in your lips

Even if it’s a false god

We’d still worship

We might just get away with it

The altar is my hips

Even if it’s a false god

We’d still worship this love

We’d still worship this love

We’d still worship this love I know heaven’s a thing

I go there when you touch me

honey, hell is when I ﬁght with you

But we can patch it up good

Make confessions and

we’re begging for forgiveness,

got the wine for you

And you can’t talk to me when I’m like this

Daring you to leave me

just so I can try and scare you,

you’re the West Village

You still do it for me babe

They all warned us about times like this

They say the road gets hard and you

get lost when you’re led by blind faith

Blind faith

Still worship this love

Even if it’s a false god

Even if it’s a false god

Still worship this love

Official “Lover” Lyrics

Written by Taylor Swift

 

We could leave the Christmas lights up

‘Til January

This is our place, we make the rules

And there’s a dazzling haze

A mysterious way about you, dear

Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close?

Forever and ever

Take me out

And take me home

You’re my, my, my, my...

Lover

We could let our friends crash

In the living room

This is our place, we make the call

And I’m highly suspicious

That everyone who sees you wants you

I’ve loved you 3 summers now, honey

But I want them all

Chorus

Ladies and gentlemen

Will you please stand

With every guitar string scar on my hand

I take this magnetic force of a man

To be my lover

My heart’s been borrowed

And yours has been blue

All’s well that ends well

To end up with you

Swear to be overdramatic and true

To my lover

And you’ll save all your dirtiest jokes

For me

And at every table, I’ll save you a seat

Lover...

Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close?

Forever and ever

Take me out

And take me home

You’re my, my, my, my...

Oh you’re my, my, my, my...

Darling you’re my, my, my, my...

Lover

Official ‘The Man’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Joel Little

I would be complex 
I would be cool
They’d say I played the ﬁeld before I found someone to commit to 
And that would be ok
For me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you 
I’d be a fearless leader
I’d be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya 
What’s that like? I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man
And I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...
Then I’d be the man 
I’d be the man
I’d be the man They’d say I hustled 
Put in the work
They wouldn’t shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve 
What I was wearing
If I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
And they would toast to me, oh
Let the players play
I’d be just like Leo
In Saint-Tropez Chorus What’s it like to brag about 
Raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models 
And it’s all good if you’re bad 
And it’s okay if you’re mad If I was out ﬂashing my dollars 
I’d be a bitch, not a baller 
They paint me out to be bad 
So it’s okay that I’m mad I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man
I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...
Then I’d be the man 
I’d be the man
I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man
And I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...
Then I’d be the man 
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
If I was a man
I’d be the man

Official ‘Daylight’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift 

My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I’ve crossed unforgiven
I’ll tell you the truth but never goodbye I don’t wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don’t wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I’ve been sleeping so long in a twenty year dark night
And now I see daylight
I only see daylight Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it’s morning now
It’s brighter now, now Chorus And I can still see it all in my mind
All of you, all of me intertwined
I once believed love would be black and white
But it’s golden And I can still see it all in my head
Back and forth from New York
Sneaking in your bed
I once believed love would be burning red
But it’s golden
Like daylight I don’t wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I could never look away
I don’t wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Things will never be the same
I’ve been sleeping so long in a twenty year dark night
And now I see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight
Like daylight
It’s golden
Like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight
And let it go
Just let it go
Let it go Spoken: 
“I want to be defined by the things that I love. Not the things I hate, not the things I’m afraid of, the things that haunt me in the middle of the night. I just think that... you are what you love.”

Official ‘It’s Nice To Have A Friend’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift, Louis Bell & Adam King Feeney

School bell rings 
Walk me home 
Sidewalk chalk 
Covered in snow 
Lost my gloves 
You give me one 
Wanna hang out
Yeah sounds like fun 
Video games
You pass me a note 
Sleeping in tents
It’s nice to have a friend 
It’s nice to have a friend Light pink sky 
Up on the roof 
Sun sinks down 
No curfew
20 questions 
We tell the truth
You been stressed out lately 
Yeah me too
Something gave 
you the nerve
To touch my hand
It’s nice to have a friend
It’s nice to have a friend Church bells ring 
Carry me home 
Rice on the ground 
Looks like snow 
Call my bluff
Call you babe 
Have my back, yeah 
Every day
Feels like home 
Stay in bed
The whole weekend
It’s nice to have a friend 
It’s nice to have a friend
It’s nice to have a friend

Official ‘Cruel Summer’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift, Jack Antonoff & Annie Clark

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night 
You know that I caught it
bad bad boy
Shiny toy, with a price 
You know that I bought it 
killing me slow
Out the window
I’m always waiting for you to be waiting below Devils roll the dice
Angels roll their eyes 
What doesn’t kill me 
Makes me want you more And it’s new
The shape of your body 
It’s blue
The feeling I got and it’s 
Ooh 
It’s a cruel summer 
It’s cool
That’s what I tell ‘em
No rules in breakable heaven but 
Ooh 
It’s a cruel summer 
With you Hang your head low
In the glow of the vending machine
I’m not dying
We say that we’ll just screw 
it up in these trying times
We’re not trying 
So cut the headlights
Summer’s a knife
I’m always waiting for you just to cut to the bone 
Devils roll the dice
Angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed you’ll be the last to know Chorus I’m drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar
Said ‘I’m ﬁne’ but it wasn’t true
I don’t want to keep secrets 
Just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate every night that summer 
Just to seal my fate
And I scream ‘For whatever it’s worth,
I love you, ain’t that the worst thing you ever heard?’ He looks up grinning like a devil Chorus I’m drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar 
Said ‘I’m ﬁne’ but it wasn’t true
I don’t want to keep secrets 
Just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate every night that summer
Just to seal my fate
And I scream ‘For whatever it’s worth,
I love you, ain’t that the worst thing you ever heard?’

Official ‘I Forgot That You Existed’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift, Louis Bell & Adam King Feeney

How many days did I spend thinking
‘Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong 
Lived in the shade you were throwing
‘Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone 
And I couldn’t get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake so yeah 
Your name on my lips, tongue tied
Free rent living in my mind
But then something happened one magical night... I forgot that you existed 
And I thought that it 
would kill me
But it didn’t
And it was so nice 
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed 
It isn’t love it isn’t hate 
It’s just indifference
I forgot that you... Got out some popcorn as soon as my rep started going down, down, down 
Laughed on the schoolyard as soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would’ve stuck around for ya 
Would’ve fought the whole town, so yeah 
Would’ve been right there front row
Even if nobody came to your show 
But you showed who you are 
Then one magical night... Chorus Sent me a clear message 
Taught me some hard lessons 
I just forget what they were... 
It’s all just a blur I forgot that you existed 
And I thought that it 
would kill me
But it didn’t
And it was so nice 
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed 
I did, I did, I did
It isn’t hate it’s just indifference
It isn’t love it isn’t hate 
It’s just indifference
So yeah...

Official ‘Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Joel Little

You know I adore you
I’m crazier for you
Than I was at sixteen
Lost in a ﬁlm scene
Waving homecoming queens
Marching band playing
I’m lost in the lights
American glory
Faded before me
Now I’m feeling hopeless
Ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns
I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life
No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It’s been a long time coming but It’s you and me
That’s my whole world 
They whisper in the hallway 
She’s a bad bad girl
The whole school is rolling fake dice 
You play stupid games 
You win stupid prizes
It’s you and me
There’s nothing like this
Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince
We’re so sad, we paint the town blue 
Voted most likely to run away with you My team is losing
Battered and bruising
I see the high ﬁves
Between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung
You are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories
Burning before me
I’m feeling helpless
The damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then
Where are the wise men?
Darling I’m scared
No cameras catch my mufﬂed cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there And now the storm is coming but Chorus And I don’t want you to GO!
I don’t really wanna FIGHT!
‘Cause nobody’s gonna WIN! I think you should come home 
And I don’t want you to GO!
I don’t really wanna FIGHT!
‘Cause nobody’s gonna WIN! I think you should come home
And I don’t want you to GO!
I don’t really wanna FIGHT!
‘Cause nobody’s gonna WIN! I just thought you should know
And I’ll never let you GO!
‘Cause I know this is a FIGHT!
That someday we’re gonna WIN! It’s you and me
That’s my whole world 
They whisper in the hallway
She’s a bad bad girl
I just thought you should know
It’s you and me
There’s nothing like this
Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince
We’re so sad, we paint the town blue 
Voted most likely to run away with you And I don’t want you to GO!
I don’t really wanna FIGHT!
‘Cause nobody’s gonna WIN!
I think you should come home 
And I’ll never let you GO!
‘Cause I know this is a FIGHT!
That someday we’re gonna WIN!
I just thought you should know It’s you and me
That’s my whole world
They whisper in the hallway 
She’s a bad bad girl
She’s a bad bad girl

Official ‘Soon You’ll Get Better’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Jack Antonoff

The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor’s ofﬁce lighting
I didn’t tell you I was scared
That was the ﬁrst time we were there
Holy orange bottles
Each night I pray to you
Desperate people ﬁnd faith
So now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you Ooh, soon you’ll get better
Ooh, soon you’ll get better
Ooh, you’ll get better soon
‘Cause you have to I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses
You make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn’t real
I’ll paint the kitchen neon
I’ll brighten up the sky
I know I’ll never get it
There’s not a day that I won’t try
And I’ll say to you Chorus And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do?
If there’s no you This won’t go back to normal
If it ever was
It’s been years of hoping
And I keep saying it because 
‘Cause I have to... Ooh, you’ll get better
Ooh, soon you’ll get better
Ooh, you’ll get better soon Ooh, soon you’ll get better
Ooh, soon you’ll get better
Ooh, you’ll get better soon 
‘Cause you have to

Official ‘Death By A Thousand Cuts’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Jack Antonoff

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk but it’s not enough ‘cause
The morning comes and
You’re not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier’s still flickering here
‘Cause I can’t pretend it’s ok when it’s not
It’s death by a thousand cuts I dress to kill my time
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it’ll be all right
They say ‘I don’t know’
And what once was ours
Is no one’s now
I see you everywhere
The only thing we share
is this small town
You said it was a great love
One for the ages
If the story’s over
Why am I still writing pages? Chorus My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Trying to find a part of me that you didn’t touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I’m searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, United we stand
Our country
Guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Trying to find a part of me you didn’t take up
Gave you too much but it wasn’t enough
But I’ll be all right
It’s just a thousand cuts I get drunk but it’s not enough ‘cause
You’re not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier’s still flickering here
‘Cause I can’t pretend it’s ok when it’s not
No it’s not
It’s death by a thousand cuts
Trying to find a part of me that you didn’t touch
My body, my love
But it wasn’t enough, it wasn’t enough, no, no I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it’ll be all right
They say ‘I don’t know’

Official ‘Cornelia Street’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift

We were in the backseat
drunk on something stronger
than the drinks in the bar
I rent a place on Cornelia Street,
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
ﬁlling in the blanks as we go
As if the streetlights pointed in an arrowhead
leading us home And I hope I never lose you
Hope it never ends
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
That’s the kind of heartbreak
Time could never mend
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby I get mystiﬁed by how
this city screams your name
And baby I’m so terriﬁed of if you ever walk away
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again Windows ﬂung right open
Autumn air, jacket round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the ﬂoor
Back when we were card sharks
Playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone
But then you called
Showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I Chorus You hold my hand
On the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion
Listen... I hope I never lose you 
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again 
Never again
And baby I get mystiﬁed by how
this city screams your name
And baby I’m so terriﬁed of if you ever walk away
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
I rent a place on Cornelia Street,
I say casually in the car

Official ‘London Boy’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift, Jack Antonoff, Cautious Clay & Mark Anthony Spears

Idris Elba: We can go driving in, on my scooter, ah you know, just round London
James Corden: Oh I love my hometown
As much as Motown
I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen
Faded blue jeans
Tennessee whiskey
But something happened
I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples ﬁrst and
then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that’s not where mine lives You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market
in the afternoon 
He likes my American smile
Like a child when our eyes meet 
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate
Met all of his best mates
So I guess
All the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you Now I love high tea
Stories from uni and the West End
You can ﬁnd me in the pub, we
Are watchin’ rugby
With his school friends
Show me a gray sky
A rainy cab ride
Babes, don’t threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God I love the English... You know I love a London boy
I enjoy nights in Brixton,
Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile
Like a child when our eyes meet 
Darling I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate
Met all of his best mates
So I guess
All the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you So please show me Hackney
Doesn’t have to be Louis V
Up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you, wanna be with you
Stick with me, I’m your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney
On the Heath
Just wanna be with you, wanna be with you, wanna be with you You know I love a London boy, I enjoy walking Soho drinking in the afternoon 
He likes my American smile
Like a child when our eyes meet
Darling I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate
Met all of his best mates
So I guess
All the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you So please show me Hackney
Doesn’t have to be Louis V
Up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you, wanna be with you
Stick with me, I’m your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney
On the Heath
Just wanna be with you, wanna be with you, wanna be with you

Official ‘Paper Rings’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Jack Antonoff

The moon is high like your friends were
the night that we ﬁrst met 
Went home and tried to stalk you on the Internet
Now I’ve read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold like the shoulder
that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe
Kiss me once ‘cause you know I had a long night
Kiss me twice ‘cause it’s gonna be all right
Three times ‘cause I waited my whole life I like shiny things
But I’d marry you with paper rings
Uh huh,
That’s right, darling
You’re the one I want and
I hate accidents
Except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh,
That’s right, darling
You’re the one I want
In paper rings
In picture frames
In dirty dreams
You’re the one I want

In the winter in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in ﬁrst, I went in too 
I’m with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back to the color
that we painted your brother’s wall
Honey without all the exes, ﬁghts, and ﬂaws
We wouldn’t be standing here so tall so
Kiss you once ‘cause you know I had a long night
Kiss you twice ‘cause it’s gonna be all right
Three times ‘cause you waited your whole life Chorus I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me baby boy
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me baby boy I like shiny things
But I’d marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that’s right
You’re the one I want 
I hate accidents
Except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, darling
You’re the one I want I like shiny things
But I’d marry you with paper rings
Uh huh,
That’s right, darling
You’re the one I want and
I hate accidents
Except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, 
That’s right, darling 
You’re the one I want In paper rings
In picture frames
In all my dreams
You’re the one I want
In paper rings
In picture frames
In all my dreams
You’re the one I want

Official ‘I Think He Knows’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Jack Antonoff

I think he knows
His footprints on the sidewalk
Lead to where I can’t stop
Go there every night
I think he knows his
Hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it’s mine
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I’m drawing up the plans
It’s like I’m seventeen
Nobody understands 
No one understands He got my heartbeat
Skipping down 16th Avenue
I got that uhh, I mean
Want to see what’s under that attitude
I want you
Bless my soul
But I ain’t gotta tell him 
I think he knows
I think he knows I think he knows
When we get all alone
I’ll make myself at home
And he’ll want me to stay
I think he knows
He’d better lock it down
Or I won’t stick around
‘Cause good ones never wait
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I’m drawing up the plans
He’s so obsessed with me and boy 
I understand 
Boy I understand Chorus I want you
Bless my 
I want you
Bless my 
I want you
Bless my 
I want you
Bless my soul Lyrical smile
Indigo eyes
Hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks I’ll drive
Lyrical smile
Indigo eyes
Hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks
I’ll drive
So where we gonna go? 
I whisper in the dark
Where we gonna go?
I think he knows Chorus I think he
I want you
Bless my
I want you
Bless my soul
I want you
Bless my 
I want you
Bless my soul
I want you
Bless my
I want you
Bless my soul
I want you
Bless my soul
But I ain’t gotta tell him 
I think he knows

Official ‘False God’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Jack Antonoff

We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I’d die for you
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I’d ﬂy to you
And I can’t talk to you when you’re like this
Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town - I’m New York City
I still do it for you babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you
get lost when you’re led by blind faith
Blind faith But we might just get away with it
Religion’s in your lips
Even if it’s a false god
We’d still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it’s a false god
We’d still worship this love
We’d still worship this love
We’d still worship this love I know heaven’s a thing
I go there when you touch me
honey, hell is when I ﬁght with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and
we’re begging for forgiveness,
got the wine for you
And you can’t talk to me when I’m like this
Daring you to leave me
just so I can try and scare you,
you’re the West Village
You still do it for me babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you
get lost when you’re led by blind faith
Blind faith 
Still worship this love
Even if it’s a false god
Even if it’s a false god
Still worship this love

Official ‘Afterglow’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift, Louis Bell & Adam King Feeney

I blew things out of proportion
Now you’re blue
Put you in jail for something you didn’t do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no
Fighting with a true love
Is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry ‘til it blows up, ‘til there’s no us 
Why’d I have to break what I love so much?
It’s on your face
And I’m to blame
I need to say Hey, it’s all me, in my head
I’m the one who burned us down
But it’s not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you 
I don’t wanna do
I don’t wanna do this to you 
I don’t wanna lose
I don’t wanna lose this with you
I need to say
Hey it’s all me, just don’t go
Meet me in the afterglow It’s so excruciating to see you low
Just want to lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the ﬁght, oh
I lived like an island
Punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why’d I have to break what I love so much
It’s on your face
Don’t walk away I need to say Chorus Tell me that you’re still mine
Tell me that we’ll be just ﬁne
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that it’s not my fault
Tell me that I’m all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say
Chorus

Official “Lover” Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift

We could leave the Christmas lights up 
‘Til January
This is our place, we make the rules 
And there’s a dazzling haze
A mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close? 
Forever and ever
Take me out
And take me home
You’re my, my, my, my... 
Lover
We could let our friends crash 
In the living room
This is our place, we make the call 
And I’m highly suspicious
That everyone who sees you wants you 
I’ve loved you 3 summers now, honey 
But I want them all
Chorus
Ladies and gentlemen
Will you please stand
With every guitar string scar on my hand 
I take this magnetic force of a man
To be my lover
My heart’s been borrowed 
And yours has been blue 
All’s well that ends well 
To end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true 
To my lover
And you’ll save all your dirtiest jokes 
For me
And at every table, I’ll save you a seat 
Lover...
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever
Take me out
And take me home
You’re my, my, my, my... 
Oh you’re my, my, my, my... 
Darling you’re my, my, my, my...
Lover

Official lyrics for ""The Archer"" written by Taylor Swift:

Combat
I'm ready for combat
I saw I don't want that
But what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown out speeches I almost said to you
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train
I ride off alone
I never grew up,
It's getting so old
Help me hold onto you
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?
Dark side
I search for your dark side
But what if I'm all right, right, right, right here?
And i cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then hate my reflection for years and years
I wake in the night
I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire
Invisible smoke
And all my heroes
Die all alone
Help me hold onto you
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Screaming who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?

'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through me
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies
Started out friends
Help me hold onto you
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay
Combat
I'm ready for combat

8w4A1vVaNmE,Taylor Swift,"Whisper hello, I miss you quite terribly.","Hey! I just made a new video blog from our trip to London this week. It includes Caitlin's alter ego, taking a walk through ""Willy Wonka's house. It's very candy-licious and there's lots of everything."" (AKA Harrod's), Amos and I sharing accessories, theft-proof remote controls, getting severely injured onstage and requiring immediate medical attention (AKA a band aid) and the coolest thing I've ever seen: Magazines with candy bars attached to them. Check it out. :) The song is one of my favorite songs ever by Hellogoodbye.
